,Trading," 

It's common for writers to scream *Bear!* using all sorts of fancy technical analysis and be wrong for months on end only to re-write their article and cry wolf again until eventually they are right. I prefer to follow the trend into resistance levels and size down for safety until the next trend is established. It's a far more patient trade plan, but it pays in profit and in lack of stress trying to chase micro-moves.

Yesterday, September 2nd, 2020 I was glancing at the SPY (S&amp;P 500 etf) daily and weekly chart to check just how far out of wack the markets were being. Within a few moments, it was clear there was a trend line that formed on major resistance points. After seeing this resistance and the current state of the market, I knew it was time to size down. I knew the trades could easily keep going, but I had a trade plan that I've relied on for years and wasn't going to stop now.

Here's the mention and chart of SPY on September 2nd...

I sized down a few of my bullish trades that were in profit and very tech focused. I had been closing some of my September 18th expiration option spreads for some time, but missed out on a decent amount of profit to play safe and had to suppress want to go back and look at how much I had missed out on despite making nearly 10% on the account in the month. Again... following the trade plan is the easiest way to avoid the emotional pitfalls that traders often fall back into before blowing up a large portion or all of their account.

After opening up the charts again this morning September 3rd, 2020 to my amazement, the timing was near perfect.

Now most traders would go back to their alert and scream *I'm a genius! Look at this!* However, we know that trading is a game of probability and that we really may be fooled by randomness so I cannot and will not take credit for being lucky with timing. What we can hypothesize from this action in the markets is that buyers are now concerned which can lead way to a further bearish movement over the next few weeks to a few months.

,Trading,"Options are a complex vehicle that most investors and traders don’t learn the basics until it’s too late. With the rise of no-commission retail brokers, the number of people who don’t truly know what they’re doing keeps increasing. In this article, I want to efficiently explain how simple it is to calculate net debit option positions so we can become smarter traders.

**Top Watch:**

As discussed in the past two articles, INTC has been our top watch for a bullish move above $52. On Thursday and Friday of last week, we entered October 18th expiration options on INTC with strike prices of 50 and 55. For simplicity, I would love to have these orders as single contracts, but the images of orders and charts I want to use require us to use actual order sizes so we’ll add a bit of extra math. Another note is that 1 contract is equal to 100 shares so a premium of $1.00 is $1x100 shares = $100.00

BTO (Buy to open) 50 strike calls @ $1.90 X 20 contracts = $3800 cost  
BTO (Buy to open) 55 strike calls @ $0.61 X 40 contracts = $2440 cost

Total cost = $6240  
Max Loss = $6240  
Max Profit = Unlimited

The risk profile is as shown where the break even price for INTC at expiration is $53.20 as shown by the pink tick mark. In order for this position to profit, it needs to move bullish before expiration or the contract decay, known as theta, will remove value from the position.

In the time since opening the trade and now, the price of INTC increased by roughly $1.50 and our position is now into profit. There are three educated choices we can make.

1. Do nothing. This is always an option until expiration when the market demands a decision.  
2. Take profit by closing the position.  
3. Adjust these call options into an option spread.

In this case, choice 3 is where I decided to focus and unfortunately the most complicated choice. I decide to use the 55 strike call options to pay for my spread… Let me explain.

STC (Sell to close) 55 strike calls @ $0.88 per contract X 40 contracts = $3520  
This closes our 55 strike calls for a profit of $3520-2440 = $1080 and that is rolled into the cost of our STO 52.5 calls as shown below.

STO (Sell to open - short) 52.5 strike calls @ $2.82 per contract X 20 contracts = $5640 (minus $1080 premium has a total premium of $4560)

At this point we have an option position with 20 contracts of 50 strike calls long and 20 contracts of 52.5 strike calls short to create the bullish vertical call spread.

[https://imgur.com/a/N6qvn1w](https://imgur.com/a/N6qvn1w) 

The total cost for this vertical spread is $4560 - $3800 = $760.

Total cost = $760  
Max Loss = $760  
Max Profit = $4240

However, our break even point is now at $50.40 on the underlying INTC shares. Our risk to reward is now extremely favorable and the price can go down a little and we still break even!

**Conclusion:**

While the “shiny object” of unlimited profit using long call options is enticing, the time decay (theta) factor moves the break even price at expiration further up requiring that options traders are correct about the magnitude of the move as well as the time that the move takes place. Ask any mathematician and they’ll easily explain that those odds are far worse than a coin flip.

With the rise of no-commission retail brokers, the number of people who don’t truly know what they’re doing keeps increasing. In this article, I want to efficiently explain how simple it is to calculate net debit option positions so we can become smarter traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Watch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the past two articles, INTC has been our top watch for a bullish move above $52. On Thursday and Friday of last week, we entered October 18th expiration options on INTC with strike prices of 50 and 55. For simplicity, I would love to have these orders as single contracts, but the images of orders and charts I want to use require us to use actual order sizes so we’ll add a bit of extra math. Another note is that 1 contract is equal to 100 shares so a premium of $1.00 is $1x100 shares = $100.00&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTO (Buy to open) 50 strike calls @ $1.90 X 20 contracts = $3800 cost&lt;br/&gt;
BTO (Buy to open) 55 strike calls @ $0.61 X 40 contracts = $2440 cost&lt;/p&gt;

I wussed out on buying the crash on the way down.  Told myself I wouldn't make the same mistake on the way up.

Here's one major thing I understand from all this.  If you're going to buy and hold bull ETFs, you have to wait for a crash and buy on a confirmed recovery. You just have to.  If you buy now, you're going to have to day trade them.  

Between TQQQ, TECL, QLD, SOXL, and RYVYX I have been making a KILLING in both unrealized and realized gains.  Every time one would dip, I'd put more in.  Is it easy watching one fund go up 6% one day and then down 4% the next?  No, never is.  Is it smart to leave a lot of money in these funds over the course of a very long time?  Probably not.  But if we could go through crashes like what happened end of 2018 and beginning of 2020 that had V shaped recoveries without these funds getting dismantled, the only thing I could see stopping them would be another 2008-2009 crash, which I'm actually waiting for because all of what's going on right now just reminds me of The Big Short so much.  

This week I dropped about half my RYVYX in my self-managed 401k because the expense ratio is just ridiculous and QLD actually beats it over he course of the last ten years.  Also this week, I dropped about half my TQQQ and TECL in my self-managed IRA.  So I could load up on some high dividend monthly stocks. I've been in these for 5 months now.  That's a lifetime when compared to how long they say you should hold these.

Thankfully I learned my lesson a long time ago to take some profit so I'm slowly doing that now and when the next crash comes, I'll be ready with my finger on the trigger.",t2_aqzdk,False,,0,False,"Internet: ""Leveraged ETFs are snake oil!""

When the price for crude oil went down early this year, I decided to buy some.

Being European I got myself an ETF that's supposed to track the price for Brent Oil.

The ISIN is PS701L.

So here's my question: The price of crude oil went up, but my ETF didn't.

You can see it quite clerarly on this chart:

Recently I had a long corn future that I was riding for a bit (ZC 9-20 contract) and logged onto my trading app to find that it had been liquidated due to a violation. They told me that I had held too long and was about to take delivery. 

Maybe I don't understand the language, the CME lists this for corn:  
""Trading terminates on the business day prior to the 15th calendar day of the contract month.""

Wouldn't that mean that I have to close the contract by the 9/14 for the ""ZC 9-20"" contract?

I realized that trading a particular system is not about the system itself but on the approach of the user, an infinite amount of strategies exist out there and if a user is littered with a negative, inpatient, impulsive, loss averse, etc mindset than not even the ""top"" performing strategies would be of use. Thus, to me it seems that I get into this negative mindset from time to time, going into frequent draw-downs and consistent losses (low success rate) but fortunately with adequate risk management (to an extent) which kept my capital alive for this past year of actively trading the Forex market (-15% thus far).
 
I am detail oriented and have a very detailed journal of every trade I take/ took (&gt;500 trades mainly Forex) with statistical calculations on the different strategies that I have formulated, implemented, and back-tested manually (and have mostly failed due to user error in live markets). I can help with providing reflection on the trade setups technically and fundamentally, formulating a trading plan from scratch, formulating strategies, establishing adequate risk management and provide self-reflection as I fully know how it could be when stuck in a negative cycle. 

I need someone to reciprocate accountability with (Currently at GMT +4 but wont mind the time difference in effort to make this work), I have a trend continuation based strategy that can work if I have the right mindset towards it, thus I would like to find someone to hold me accountable for the trades I enter during the week (end of week review) and also share ideas with back and forth on the different setups that are provided during the week.

,Trading,"I am following the markets for some time and I noticed a rapid growth in Tesla stock price that happened recently (and is still going on) and which I would like if someone can help me understand.

During the most of the last year the price was somewhere at $250, give or take. Then in the last quarter it started to grow steadily and was priced at around $400 by the end of the year, even though there weren't much of a change within the company itself. Then in January 2020. the price started to grow to around $600-$700, spiking in February at $950.

Then it looks like the stock turned into bearish, with the price steadily dropping back to about $400 in the next month or so, after when it started gaining again. At first, it rose to about $800 and then to $900 in the next 2-months period.

Then, about two months ago, something happened and the price started rapidly going up, day after day, gaining maybe roughly $150 per week. Price is currently at $2,001.83 and it has rose above the price of an ounce of gold, which is currently priced at $1,957.70.  Based on the trend, it looks like it is going to gain even more in the coming days.

Now I know that those two instruments are not to be compared, because gold has somewhat steady and secure price (it also has price ""bumps"", but nothing major), while this Tesla stock is over-priced and turning into a bubble that looks like it will burst anytime soon. But I am wondering if anyone can explain to me how come it managed to get to this point? Why did its price started rising so fast?

,Trading,"t/w : depression

It all started when I received a phone call from an affilate of Avatrade called [tradingacademy.io](https://tradingacademy.io). I wanted to start trading before but didn't know where to start, it was such a coincidence. So I started with $500 with the account manager provided by Avatrade. I was gaining profit but didn't want to put more money in, I was coerced into adding more money in by the account manager called ""Simon Laskas"". So I did. After a week, I doubled my money and wanted to withdraw but Simon told me to cancel it because we need money in the account. So I cancelled it and continued trading (It was dumb of me). It was a BA stock I was in. After a week, the stocks started falling, I wanted to close everything but Simon told me to hold it in because it will bounce back up (he knew full well that I'm unable to sustain it). Every day I would ask him if I should close it but he would constantly tell me to hold it in....I cried day in and day out because my savings was at stake....

&amp;#x200B;

My margin acc was about 50% at that time....He coerced me into putting more money in at the cost of using my credit card. I know its dumb...I know man...The very next day, after putting all my money in maxxing out my credit card, he then told me to close a position....Which closed everything and totally demolished my account to 0. I lost everything....my savings...my credit card maxed out...On top of that, after a few weeks, I received a letter from my bank saying I have to pay certain amount within a month. Ofc I had no money then...I've developed depression and anxiety, even on top of that, Simon was still calling me, telling me to put money in the account....I really wanted to kill myself then....

&amp;#x200B;

So a month after, I received a severance payment from my previous job...which is what I will be using to fund my account.

,Trading,"Hi everyone, I just opened my Roth IRA and am watching all the learning videos and reading up on investing as much as I can, so I haven't started trading yet. I've also had my 401K for about 13 years but leave it alone for the most part. I'm aiming to be more active in my investments as I educate myself.

My problem is that I'm asleep during trading hours. I'm thinking of keeping my retirement accounts as index/mutual funds and opening a separate investment account that I can put a little money in and actively trade a few stocks here and there when I'm awake. The earliest I can be awake to trade is about 3 p.m. Eastern Time, which leaves me about an hour to trade. I can do this a few times a week without losing quality sleep.

One advice I got from another sub is that I should make an exact plan on what to buy and sell before going to bed, then trade when I wake up. I've also been told ETFs would be good since they're traded at the end of the day, and not that often. I was also advised to avoid trading after-hours as it's risky, and that I can't buy international stocks that easily.

,Trading,"Hi everyone

So I have done some trading, on and off now for maybe 2 years, and never really got anywhere with it. I guess you can say i did it for fun and never really had the time to fully commit to it. Recently I just finished ""How to day trade for a living"" and throught i would start to take it more seriously.

For now I'm concentrating on a simple MACD and EMA200 crossover stratgy that I watched on the YT channel Trading Rush, which showed a win rate of roughly 60%.  I decided to backtest this strategy myself on TradingView and my result was similar with his results of roughly 60% after testing it over nearly 9 months worth of data(During the times of day that i would trade).

However,  when i went live to the markets this week(On a demo account) my winrate is coming out at just 19%! It literally felt like I lost every position!

Can you think of any other suggests as for why there is such a massive difference between my backtested strategy and my live market results? 

 I had two positions, where one hit my stop loss  before reversing and then continued in the predicted direction that i wanted it to go, and another where it went in the predicted direct but reversed just 10 points short of my take profit(unfortunately i was busy so missed this) it then went in the opposite direction and took out my stop loss, so i can justify these losses, but the rest of the time it just seemed like it kept going against me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've added my graphcs here.   
[https://imgur.com/a/MK3KjI2](https://imgur.com/a/MK3KjI2)

Although i stuck with my 1:2 ratio on every trade, I stupidly was changing the amount of money per trade depending on what i was trading... anywhere from ""$200:$400 to $100:$200"" so I know I need to work on a consistant 1% or 0.5% risk etc rather than changing the amount risked per trade. However i still dont see why this would result in such a drastic loss this week!

This one's a bit of a weird question but I couldn't find anything from my own searches and wouldn't know where else to post this - I'm looking to organize a currency speculation / forex trading competition (if not, stock &amp; shares will do too) at my college and was looking for a platform that would allow you to create ranked trading groups and trade with virtual cash within that group.

There used to be a good one called Bullbearings, where you could set up a virtual trading group and see individual user's net gain/loss within that group, but that sadly closed down a few years ago - something similar to that platform would definitely be what I'm looking for!

If any of you know any platforms that could be used for competitions, or a better place to ask this question, please let me know!

From my understanding (which is probably flawed), in order to make money on the market he needs an edge.

,Trading,"Hi guys. I’m currently using TradingView to place my trades with FXCM, but I’m having issues with FXCM disconnecting from TradingView and logging me out of TradeStation or whatever their own platform is called. It’s very frustrating when I’ve got open positions that I’m monitoring and then suddenly I can’t access my account. Also on the days that I work I’d still like to be able to trade but you can’t place trades through TradingView’s mobile app so I’m considering changing broker all together. I really like how easy it is to manage your money on TradingView by using the long/short position tool and setting your stop loss to 1% of your account. This is one of the main reasons why I use the platform. Are there any apps that have similar tools, preferably a broker that I can still use through TradingView when I have chance to sit at my computer?

What apps do you recommend for easy trading and money management? I’ve tried Think or Swim but apparently they don’t let UK residents trade with them and OANDA doesn’t let European residents trade through third party platforms which is frustrating.

,Trading,"I made a similar post in /r/investing, but it's probably more relevant here. If you recommend a platform and I make the switch to it, I'll Paypal/Venmo you $100 (or make a $100 donation to a reputable US-based charity of your choosing if you prefer not to send your email...bitcoin would probably work too if that's easy enough for me to set up).  Scout's honor on whether I make the switch. (It may take a couple weeks for me to make a decision and potentially switch.)

I'm a part-time fundamental trader and primarily trade equities and options. I use e\*Trade which is what I've always used because I fell into trading after being purely a long-term investor. There are a lot of limitations to e\*Trade, and it's high time that I see if I can find a platform that's better for my style of trading. I'm wondering if anyone could recommend another broker that you've been pleased with that has some features that would be helpful for me. Basically, I'm looking for the ability to organize and track my positions more easily within the platform itself.

I primarily do my research outside of market hours and place orders to open positions that have one day to several month time horizons, so I don't need fancy real-time dashboards for playing super short-term movements (though it would be nice to see an order book when placing orders).

Below are the features that I'd like to have. I doubt any platform has all of these, but if one has several (and favorable fees), it'd help me a lot:

* (Top Need) Allows for positions to be sorted into thematic folders and be able to see the current balance of each, and ideally the performance of each (but the balance is fine). 
   * It'd be great if it allows a % of every position within a thematic folder to be sold with one bulk action, but this may be a stretch. (I park a lot of idle cash in newly IPO'ed SPACs, and if I need the cash for a large more active position, I have to manually sell a portion of each.)
      * It'd also be great if it's possible to set a sequence of events i.e. Sell X at market and buy Y at market.
* Supports the input of custom note types for individual positions, as well as the convenient display of these notes  (i.e. ""Investment Thesis"", ""Anticipated Holding Period"", ""Number of Attached Warrants"", etc) in columns alongside the statistics for the position. e\*Trade allows notes, but it's not very visible.
* Allows the set-up of some sort of warning message when going to sell a specific position (i.e. You asked me to remind you before selling: ""Do not sell this unless it looks like Joe Biden is going to lose the election. Are you sure he's going to lose?"")
* Allows for both automated and custom reminders to be configured for individual positions (i.e. toggle on/off reminders for upcoming earnings call(s), product announcements, etc as well as custom reminders like ""In 12 months, remind me to to assess whether Walmart+ is gaining traction. If not, sell half of this position.""
* Makes it easy to set both a stop-loss order and a limit sell order (so the position is sold if it crosses a lower / upper limit). There are positions that I'd only like to hold to a certain point. Currently, if I have a stop-loss order set for risk management as I do on several positions, I cannot also set a limit sell order to take profit at a certain level.
* Allows for open orders to be programmed to cancel if certain criteria are met (i.e. I have a 60-day buy order in for call options on a certain stock that is under contract to be acquired for cash. If the stock price falls below a certain threshold, it almost certainly signals that the buyer somehow backed out.

I want to take a semester or more off law school to focus exclusively on trading; I think I see a path forward to success in this industry. However, 5k+ in 3 months is not even close to enough. When I started I was looking at the E\*Trade retail website not knowing anything, so I had to teach myself and lost money for about a month consistently before finally making some good trades and then losing more than before, so I guess most profits have come in the last 6 weeks approx.

I was looking at level 2 on an OTC stock today and I was surprised that all I could see are MM bids and asks. It appears different than level 2 on Nasdaq traded securities, making trades more opaque. Does this have to be the case or can I receive more information about level 2 in the OTC markets? Why is level 2 in the Nasdaq different? It seems like those bids and asks are those placed by retail investors.

Maybe I can add a MACD to see if there is going to be a soon to happen convergence and have  a more solid grasp of how soon the trend will be possibly  reversing or if it'll still go on.

,Trading,"When I first started trading, I used to add all indicators on my chart. MACD, RSI, super trend, ATR, ichimoku cloud, Bollinger Bands, everything!

My chart was pretty messy. I understood nothing and my analysis was pretty much just a gamble.

Nothing worked.

Then I learned price action trading. And things started to change. It seemed difficult and unreliable at first.

There's a saying in my country. ""Bhav Bhagwan Che"" it means ""Price Is GOD"".

That holds true in the market.

Amos Every indicator you see is based on price. RSI uses open/close price and so does moving average. MACD uses price.

Price is what matters the most.

Everything depends on the price, and then the indicators send a signal.

Price Action trading is trading based on Candlestick patterns and support and resistance. You don't use any indicators (SMA sometimes), use plot trend lines and support and resistance zones, maybe Fibs or Pivot points.

It is not 100% successful, but the win rate is quite high if you know how to analyse it correctly.

,Trading,"I dunno what’s going on. 
I started trading a few months back. Eveything was great I had full confidence in my strategy. When I lost money I didn’t mind. But was coming out green every week. 
In my last 14 trades, even though I feel as if I’ve improved I’ve lost money on 11 of them... I keep seeing a perfect set up and doubting it, taking too long to make my mind up and then watch it shoot up without placing a single trade. Then not thinking straight getting into a trade which doesn’t follow my plan because I’m annoyed about missing out. 

I know it’s a very broad answer but how did you stop trading with emotions and follow your plan as closely as possible? 

I tried making my trading plan even more precise so there’s no gray areas but there’s still something in the back of my mind making me doubt everything I do.

I started trading a few months back. Eveything was great I had full confidence in my strategy. When I lost money I didn’t mind. But was coming out green every week. 
In my last 14 trades, even though I feel as if I’ve improved I’ve lost money on 11 of them... I keep seeing a perfect set up and doubting it, taking too long to make my mind up and then watch it shoot up without placing a single trade. Then not thinking straight getting into a trade which doesn’t follow my plan because I’m annoyed about missing out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it’s a very broad answer but how did you stop trading with emotions and follow your plan as closely as possible? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried making my trading plan even more precise so there’s no gray areas but there’s still something in the back of my mind making me doubt everything I do. &lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hey guys,

I'm new to this to please excuse the noob question 

I've been offered a chance through a good friend to get involved with a trader who's making my mate money trading for him on his account, CFDs

So far he's smashing it for them and my question is this.

What's am I missing? It seems too good to be true and you know what they say about that 

There's a small monthly fee then over a certain amount he gets 30% of the profits 

My first concern was if he miss managed the money I could get into debt but from talking the the platform I'm trading on they said that could never happen and if it did they'd write it off if I wanted to stop trading with them.

So as far as I can see all I'm risking is my deposit plus whatever profit is made,  I could never get into debt which was my only major concern 

Is there anything else I should be worried about that could go wrong apart from him wiping my account out?

Could there be a bigger play here from him I'm missing or is this just a trader trying to get rich faster via other people's accounts with no risk to himself?

As part of my process, I'm trying to be clever and pay off my wedding expenses before starting to put hard onto investing funds, so I only give myself at best £20-30 a month to play with as junk food or games/whatever money, but instead of waiting and ONLY studying trading for the next year or so, I would really like a bit of experience and context trying some trading with a little 'throwaway cash'. 

Some might suggest the trading platform trials with a pretend 50K to play with, but it's far less realistic for me to ever achieve having 5K before even starting,  is this an option anywhere?

,Trading,"Hello guys! I have been trading in the Financial markets for about 4 years now. Last year I got an opportunity to trade in the electricity markets of USA (**ERCOT** to be specific). I didn't know such markets even existed until then. 

Over the past year and a half, I realized these markets are highly seasonal and **predictable accuracy** is higher compared to any other financial markets (as there's a lot of political influence on a daily basis in most other financial assets), the underlying fact being that the behavior of people changes over years (sometimes decades) which in actual influences the demand and of course supply is limited to their maximum outputs from traditional methods and renewable sources like Wind and Nuclear are a pain in the arse to the producers of electricity as they can't be controlled/managed instantaneously to change the output of electricity based on demand (All of this makes sense because electricity can't be stored economically and the best bet right now is to try and match the demand and supply simultaneously). So, electricity traders could even take advantage of negative prices. 

Anyways, my point is that I realized the US and European electricity markets are quite different in their structure. While USA promotes good spread between the prices in the Day Ahead(yes, buyers and sellers go for an auction a day ahead but there are also real-time markets to manage the unexpected changes in demand and supply) and hence the Real-Time markets, Europe tries to keep it to a minimal. Recently, I came across **NordPool** where we could trade the majority electricity markets in the Europe. I would like to know if some of you are in this line of profession or business and how feasible is it to trade the European electricity markets given that their motive is to keep the spread between their Day-Ahead and Real-Time markets as less as possible. If I were to build a web-based analytics tool(to use for myself and sell it too eventually) to trade the products offered by NordPool would it be a profitable deal as I can't stick to ERCOT since I'm moving to the Europe soon.

,Trading,"Hey guys,

I'm not sure if all of you here have come across both methods, or whether you have tried them out both yourself, but essentially, I'm having a dilemma with 2 very different methods of approach and outcomes to trading the markets.

1\. How the institutions do it:
* Systematic, using algorithms and a very methodical approach.
* Longer term, usually a matter of days or weeks or months.
* Includes Hedging and various other methods to preserve profits and reduce risk.
* Good profits usually means 20-30% gains per annum.

2\. How retail traders do it:
* Discretionary, usually price action based, reactive trading.
* Shorter term, typically Day Trading. No overnight positions (there are always longer term traders, but I'm talking most)
* Good profits can range from 20%-1000% per annum.

So. I'm pretty sure the professional/institutional side of the story is real. Because it makes much more sense and the profits are also within realistic values.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if all of you here have come across both methods, or whether you have tried them out both yourself, but essentially, I&amp;#39;m having a dilemma with 2 very different methods of approach and outcomes to trading the markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. How the institutions do it:
* Systematic, using algorithms and a very methodical approach.
* Longer term, usually a matter of days or weeks or months.
* Includes Hedging and various other methods to preserve profits and reduce risk.
* Good profits usually means 20-30% gains per annum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. How retail traders do it:
* Discretionary, usually price action based, reactive trading.
* Shorter term, typically Day Trading. No overnight positions (there are always longer term traders, but I&amp;#39;m talking most)
* Good profits can range from 20%-1000% per annum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the professional/institutional side of the story is real. Because it makes much more sense and the profits are also within realistic values. However, there are all these retail traders out there boasting and posting doubling their capital within a month or so. Yes, I&amp;#39;m sure some are fake, but I don&amp;#39;t think ALL of them are phonies?&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hi,

First off sorry if this turns out to be an extremely stupid question, but I've just got this idea, and I wanted to share it and see if it makes any sense and if it does, what's it called in the industry so I could research it more. It's essentially about exchanging currencies. I am a software developer, but I like to think about stuff sometimes and this is the latest thing I've come up with:

So, say you have an exchange market:

* with rates for 3 currencies
* there is a buy rate and a sell rate for each currency pair
* the buy/sell rates between pairs is *relative to each-other*  (this means you may buy currency A cheaper if you're using currency B than currency C, hope this makes sense)

So with the above 3 points, I'll give the following trading example (using real exchange rates from a national bank). You have CAD as your base currency . The target is to get 100 USD.

* Simplest exchange: buy 100 USD for 135.80 CAD
* But 100 USD may also be bought with 87.61 EUR.
* But  for 87.61 EUR you have to pay only 135.79 CAD.
* Therefore it's cheaper for you to change your CAD -&gt; EUR -&gt; USD.  And Bonus, at the end of the day you may sell your $100 for CAD and end up with your profit of 0.1 CAD (sure the sell rate may be smaller than the buy rate, in reality, but you may still end-up with anything between 0 and 0.1).

Does this make any sense ? Am I over-simplifying it, what else am I missing ?

What would this be called in real-life-trading ?

Do the exchange markets actively protect themselves against this ? (I would assume so - if the idea makes sense in the first place)

If this makes any sense at all, things can get interesting then you add more than 3 currencies

,Trading," Hey everyone. Had a trade sent over in FSLY that had quite a bit going on. It started on 6 July w/ a (4) short 65/105 strangles. After it started moving, he began adjusting the strangle (took the puts down, rolled the calls) then added more calls and eventually put on a 90 straddle as well. 

A few notes.

* Let the trade work. Intervention should be a last line. We should afford the trade every opportunity to work.
* Be focused in your repair strategy. Having defined criteria and adjustments will make the trade easier to manage.
* Take advantage of opportunity. He saw great premium in a straddle and went for it - despite the rest of the position not doing well. 
* When adding different legs and strategies, I like to track separately then add the total PnLs together - makes following the position quite a bit easier.

I'm a quant analyst at a high-frequency trading firm, and currently working on the above topic. To give you a rough idea, what I am working on is as follows: When the market is NOT conceivably trending in any direction (consolidating phase), we quote the bid and ask prices, i.e, we ""make"" the markets and try to keep our delta as small as possible for hedging purposes. However, when there is a noticeable trend, we cancel all our standing orders, and send IOC orders to ""take"" the market, and increase our delta-risk so as to make a bigger profit than market making.

,Trading,"Hi all.

I've been fascinated by the financial market for some time now. But I have always been wondering **why are there patterns in stocks?**

Is this due to the fact that there is an abundance of day traders (or companies) that spend their time analysing the market and playing on these patterns? This would mean if everyone sees a pattern that would be bullish that everyone would buy a stock so it does indeed go up. Does this mean that it is a psychological game? The patterns work because everyone thinks they work that way?

Or is it just the nature of stocks, and there is nothing to do about it. I invest plentiful in stocks for the long-term (10+ years), so I don't pay attention to patterns. But do I indirectly, unknowingly, add to the effect of the pattern? Or are people like me that make a bearish pattern eventually bullish because I am not paying attention to the patterns? Connected to this question is then: do patterns only work if there is a certain ratio of short term / long term traders?

I want to understand more about this subject; not just by looking up patterns and blindly agreeing it is bullish or bearish; but by understanding the fundamentals of patterns, why do they appear, who makes them appear, and whether it's all just psychological warfare.

As a bonus question, does it make a difference to look at patterns in months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds? Does this just depend on how many active traders are trading in that time period? e.g. if no one actively trades in hours, then it doesn't make sense to do it (this couples back to the fact that active traders agree on patterns, so psychological effect).

,Trading,"Spent a month studying up lurking reddit, YouTube, investopedia.  Paper traded during the study time, resetting initial balance each time I explored a new strategy till it was consistently winning...day trades or 2-5 day windows, using Webull.  Afraid of options and margin (for now, too green).

Put $2500 in, up 8.93% 1 1/2 weeks in...so far so good.

Current strategy is using IC, MACD, StochRSI indicators, scanning for stocks with high volatility and higher than normal volume between 1m and 1d windows, and pulling the trigger on something pre-market that meets the following conditions: 

All three indicators at the beginning of a positive trend crossover for open

A positive news cycle during closing the night before or early early morning for the company

Dow futures up at least 100

As soon as market opens I watch it like a hawk and try to sell the peak of the first bump, anywhere from 5-45min in watching both indicators and other stocks in same industry as a cue for trend direction...sell point is anywhere from 3-8% unless bad news taints the market as a whole, then I pull the chute immediately.

Here's what's next...I finally received a settlement check for $83k from a bicycle accident 2yrs ago and I'm depositing it in my webull account tomorrow so I'm ready for a possible play in VXX as I think I have strong data to support a massive market dive 2-3 weeks from now.

What (if anything) am I doing right, what should I absolutely absorb knowledge on before proceeding further, what tools/insight should I add/replace in current setup to enhance my current strategy?  

Not looking to YOLO (apart from VXX play, very low downside), however would be interested in other strategies that can net consistent 2-5% gains per trade.  I figure if I can maintain 4-5 trades/day I should be able to nest up half into a few stable growth picks with good dividends, 40% back into current strategy, 10% into options/swing trades until I get it down.

Feel free to tear this apart...I'd like to think I'm not an idiot, but usually anyone that isn't willing to admit that they can be ends up proving themselves wrong fast.  Mild autism and OCD...might help me see patterns, might cause analysis paralysis, might dive in 100% confident in theory only to have missed something obvious to everyone else, would like to avoid the last one.

Lets say Stock ABC is trading at $20 currently

1) Say the $18 strike CALL is trading at $1.95, how come I always see the $17 strike trading at say $2.75. Why is it not just strictly a dollar higher? If i buy the 17 strike, shouldn't it be strictly worth $100 more than the alternative since it lets be buy 100 shares of ABC for a dollar less?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Say the $22 strike call has a delta of 0.40, thus if ABC goes up say $1, the option price goes up $0.40. How come it doesnt go up a dollar? Since the option allows me to buy it for $22 and if the price goes up a $1, shouldnt it always go up $100??

Hi, i saw this IQ Option site, and would like to give it a try, but i heard stories about how people cant withdraw or chart magically changes itself when you start trading with real money, that IQ Options is manipulating chart so you lose.

i plan to invest only 40 $, no more and no less.

should i proceed? if i make some money, i plan to quickly withdraw, so i can feel it is real thing.

i heard a lot that this binary trading is risky, but i saw somewhere how to earn ever if you lose once. this is how they described:

i deposit 40 $ on account, and i start trading only with 1$, because it supports that low.

and if i lose 1 $ , next time, i multiply it with 2.5 so i could cover my first try and this secod try, so i can earn from both. so if i lose 1$ by putting on BUY, i invest 2.5$ and choose SELL, and if i lose again, i invest 6.25$ and choose BUY, and if i lose again i invest 15.62$ and choose SELL, and if i loose again i invest 39.06$ and choose BUY.

those who explained this method say, that you will always win on this, it maybe dont have to be first try, but definitely you will not go more than 4 tries, you will always win this way and get money.

so basically strategy is to chose opposite from what i choosed and to multiply by 2.5, so i can cover previous, and earn from all those.

is IQ Options a scam, do they allow you to withdraw money without any problems, because i read that thay cant withdraw more money than how much you gave deposit if you payed with visa card, you need to use like skrill or similar ebanking in order to get money on visa card.

and what other would you reccomend, because i needwithdraw to work every time.",t2_3ilbxsr1,False,,0,False,"IQ Options, real trader?",[],r/Trading,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_hl9p4c,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1593921851.0,text,6,,,text,self.Trading,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, i saw this IQ Option site, and would like to give it a try, but i heard stories about how people cant withdraw or chart magically changes itself when you start trading with real money, that IQ Options is manipulating chart so you lose.&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hi all,

I want to begin investing in stocks but not doing so until I have done proper research.

One of the main research points has been wether to go with CFD or actual stocks, when researching this I read this 

&gt; “If the cost of the stock goes up, the broker, which offers these contracts, gives you the profit, and if the price goes down, you need to cover the losses.”

Does this mean I have to pay extra on top of what I already paid for the CFD or does this just mean I’ve lost however much the price has dropped?

What are the real benefits of CFD also, I’ve read conflicting statements where it says the risk is too high for new traders and others say it is good for new traders due to the possibility of short term investments. 

I feel I “know” when to invest and keep up to date with all business news etc. so feel from that aspect I am going in the right direction.

I’ve opened a Trading212 account and been playing around with the practise account for a bit and really enjoy it.

I am a pretty experienced trader but people tend to not take me seriously because I’m a woman. Here is one example that has made me feel this way, do any of you have experiences like this?

I have a male friend who got a new trading platform picked up by investors (with a team) even though I have absolutely never heard of him trading before 
We have grown apart since and he came back to talk to me today and tried to make me feel inferior by using buzz words and making my strategy seem invalid. He also clearly stated his return to try and seem more impressive, I didn’t ask.

I have had a foot in the investing game before he has, I research the market, I was hired by 3 people to help manage their investments/advise finances, and I just absolutely have more experience with it.

To make matters worse, my career is SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT so I am always building apps, programs, webapps, etc. and he is trying to sound as if he understands more about those things when he is (and has always been) in the medical field. He has someone else developing this trading platform and I know for a fact from the start that he had no intentions of working with the software.

I have no issue with people who are less experienced and I love helping people with things related to trading and money. That is why I am trusted to manage the assets of 3 people. I just feel that there is no other reason for people to treat me this way when it is not a competition

,Trading,"Hello Trading Community!

I was hoping someone could please give me some clarity on this question:

When you sell a stock, I know we are selling to a market maker that provides liquidity. 

My current understanding is that we are not selling directly to another investor but to an institution or market maker on the exchange that is holding our stock. Essentially, every sell and every buy, they are ticking upwards or downwards on the bid / ask spread. 

What I am curious is, is that Tim Sykes has said to not put a physical stop loss, but a mental / manual one, so the market makers don't stop you out. How exactly does that even play out? If all of these transactions are moving the spread up and down, they are profiting every time the price reverses. Why would holding out longer help their profit line?

The only I see this being true is that a third party (institutional, hedge fund, or another market maker) comes into the party and decides to take a position to short, triggering the majority of the stops that retails are trading on, and then unloading a buy position after--- but wouldn't they have to cover as well?

Has anyone tried investing or backtesting a portfolio using their list of high alpha names for over a year? Their historical list only goes back to March.

I took their list from March and plugged it in Finviz and I see a nice equity curve returning +200% over the SPY. It has about a 50% drawdown due to the nature of the holdings during the COVID downturn but can be hedged to smooth the drawdown to 25%.

Results are amazing just wondering why I can't seem to find much articles or research about using weighted alpha in a portfolio. Now I understand this is highly weighted towards recent performance, but I think this approach is worth looking into.

I am trying to decide and work out a strategy based on dynamic hedging.

So for example, I have  strategy which can possibly outperform SPY by 2 times, but in a bull market.

I want to start hedging when there is turbulence in market possibly with liquidating some portfolio and getting Long on some bonds (so not exactly hedging but lower returns)

I want to know what criteria can I use to decide if the market should be hedged like I can use VIX, I can use six month ROE for the stocks and stop if negative or something else?

,Trading,"Over the last two weeks I’ve interacted with over 400 investors directly. It was a mix of educational chats, creating a videos, and discussing strategy/trades. Something I’ve noticed is that many traders don’t seem to understand what they’re trading for, what success looks like, and it’s no surprise that folks are having a hard time creating a plan to get there. 

Investing is similar to any other life goal. We need to understand what success looks like (extremely individualized) then work our way back. How do we measure it? What’s the timeline? Is it challenging yet achievable? What’s the plan to make it happen?

If you haven’t taken the time to truly define what you want to achieve with your investing career, you’ll likely wander aimlessly drifting between profitability. I know we joke about it but “doubling my account”,  “living off dividends”, “beating the market”, “being rich”, or “buying a car I’ve always wanted” are all superficial and add little context for you to model your trading plan after. 

If you’re unsure how to develop a goal, reach out to the community. That’s what we’re here for. To support one another’s development.

,Trading,"After Nikola went public earlier this month through a reverse merger with VectorIQ, the stock has skyrocketed, and Nikola is now worth $23.78 billion. With Nikola trading only $1 billion away from the current value of Ford and not expecting revenue until at least late 2021, I feel everyone can agree this company is overvalued.

One reason the stock has exploded in value is due to the potential ""$10 billion in sales"" coming from ""14,000 reservations."" Nikola is not expecting the production of its trucks to begin until at least late 2021. This delay would be followed by full production capability being met sometime in the second half of 2022. Currently, there are only 39 hydrogen filling stations in the U.S. (35 in California). This number is tiny in comparison to the approximately 25,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. as of March 2020. It would be a considerable feat if Nikola were able to finish developing their truck, construct a manufacturing facility, and construct the hydrogen infrastructure around the country necessary for a fleet of hydrogen vehicles to operate all in just two years.

Hydrogen vehicles are also inherently less efficient than electric vehicles. A hydrogen vehicle requires that 1) electricity be used to produce and compress hydrogen (Nikola claims all its hydrogen stations will use this method with renewable energy), and 2) that stored hydrogen be used in a hydrogen vehicle to create electricity. So basically, electricity is used to make hydrogen, and that hydrogen is then used to produce electricity again. Fully electric cars do not have to convert electricity and are therefore more efficient. Currently, converting water to hydrogen is approximately 75% efficient and requires a massive amount of electricity. Nikola claims that they will use renewable energy to produce all the hydrogen at its stations, which will undoubtedly increase costs further.

The increased costs associated with hydrogen are why both Honda and Toyota have virtually abandoned their fuel cell vehicle development. In fact, Honda's fuel cell-powered Clarity had such low sales that Honda developed it to be a fully electric vehicle that runs on batteries.

Hydrogen is not the way to a more renewable future and is almost always going to be a more expensive and less efficient option when compared to electricity. While I am not arguing that Tesla specifically will be the winner, I do think it will be an electric semi-truck from some manufacturer. Volkswagen, Mercedes, Porsche, and many other vehicle manufacturers are investing heavily in electric vehicles because they know it is the best route to take.

,Trading,"(UPDATE) When I last discussed Tyson as an investment on May 27th, the stock closed at $62.75 per share. Today the stock closed at $64.02, just $1.27 higher than the price three weeks ago. At this current price, Tyson continues to remain an attractive long-term investment.

Tyson received a price target of $83 per share by Bernstein on June 4th, representing a current upside potential of roughly 30%. Bernstein noted Tyson facilities are beginning to reopen with new social distancing guidelines that are designed to limit the spread of the virus within factories. On June 10th, the company received yet another Overweight rating from Credit Suisse with a $75 price target. Credit Suisse noted how declines in slaughter volume decreased dramatically in May and bottomed out in the first week of June as demand began to recover. While the risk remains that a second outbreak could cause headaches for Tyson, financial institutions are starting to see Tyson manage the coronavirus situation much better than before.

Also, on June 3rd, the meat production industry took a significant hit as the Department of Justice indicted four former Pilgrims Pride and Claxton Poultry Farms executives for fixing the prices of their meat. These two companies have been under investigation since 2012 and while Tyson has seen no such charges. On June 10th, Tyson showed its solidarity against price-fixing by announcing that it will be cooperating with the Justice Department to investigate price-fixing within the industry further.

a) Allow non-UK European accounts

b)   Have a platform that's suited to frequent trades with small margins  and  somewhat complex strategies (e.g. low-to-no commission on a  per-trade  basis other than the exchange fee, rich APIs + support for  more order  type than just sell/buy)

c)  Have a  wide range of instruments available (e.g. allowing for margins  on SL  order and/or dealing in CFDs, providing options, futures and  having  those available for stocks, bonds, ETFs, currencies and  commodities  traded on all major exchanges)

I'm   sure these brokers exist for ""real"" customers that trade millions a   day, in my case I have a sort of mid-volume strategy, where I trade e.g.   \~20,000$ worht of volume each day (of course, depends on the day,  could  be between 0 and 50,000$ worth), so I don't have access to those  kinds  of brokers.

Up until now I've considered/tried:

* etoro (primitive interface, high fees, few instruments and symbols available)
* IG   index (kind of makes the cut, but horrible customer support and no way   to update to a ""premium"" account, stopped trading with them because of   an account issue that wasn't resolved in 1+ month)
* Saxo Bank (commissions are crazy high, their client is not great)
* IB   (I feel like you'd need 2+ years of training to use their interface, I   tried to upload some documents required to trade a certain type of   derivative and after 1+ hour of 60 second loading screens and loops I   gave up on them)... potentially still the best option, since commissions   are decent and they are big enough to \*hopefully\* have a working   system, but I'd rather use a more modern platform
* XTB (commissions are crazy high, very limited selection of instruments and symbols)
* Exante   ... basically makes the cut for everything, except for the fact that   their platform has weird bugs every now and then that I don't feel   comfortable with. E.g. just yesterday a stop loss was not triggered   because some internal system error and I kept holding on to a plummeting   stock until I saw it (granted, lost almost nothing, but the idea of   this happening to a high volume trade scares me)

&lt;p&gt;c)  Have a  wide range of instruments available (e.g. allowing for margins  on SL  order and/or dealing in CFDs, providing options, futures and  having  those available for stocks, bonds, ETFs, currencies and  commodities  traded on all major exchanges)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m   sure these brokers exist for &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; customers that trade millions a   day, in my case I have a sort of mid-volume strategy, where I trade e.g.   ~20,000$ worht of volume each day (of course, depends on the day,  could  be between 0 and 50,000$ worth), so I don&amp;#39;t have access to those  kinds  of brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now I&amp;#39;ve considered/tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etoro (primitive interface, high fees, few instruments and symbols available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IG   index (kind of makes the cut, but horrible customer support and no way   to update to a &amp;quot;premium&amp;quot; account, stopped trading with them because of   an account issue that wasn&amp;#39;t resolved in 1+ month)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saxo Bank (commissions are crazy high, their client is not great)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IB   (I feel like you&amp;#39;d need 2+ years of training to use their interface, I   tried to upload some documents required to trade a certain type of   derivative and after 1+ hour of 60 second loading screens and loops I   gave up on them)... potentially still the best option, since commissions   are decent and they are big enough to *hopefully* have a working   system, but I&amp;#39;d rather use a more modern platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XTB (commissions are crazy high, very limited selection of instruments and symbols)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exante   ... basically makes the cut for everything, except for the fact that   their platform has weird bugs every now and then that I don&amp;#39;t feel   comfortable with. E.g. just yesterday a stop loss was not triggered   because some internal system error and I kept holding on to a plummeting   stock until I saw it (granted, lost almost nothing, but the idea of   this happening to a high volume trade scares me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any other players on the market at the moment?&lt;/p&gt;

As we are publishing this article gold is trading at $1730 however the white metal is hovering around $17.50 per ounce. It’s been around a month since we published our last research report(Gold was trading at $1672) when we tried to explain to you the key reasons why gold prices could explode. In this article, we would forecast the gold and silver prices for short as well as for the long term. enough talk now let’s get straight to the analysis.

More than 45m people in the US have filed for unemployment benefits

more than 45m people in the US have filed for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus outbreak has started which is about 30% of the workforce. The pandemic has led to an alarming surge in the losses of people jobs soaring the unemployment level to a post-World War II record high.

The US unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent in May 2020 from 14.7% in April which was the largest in records back to 1939 and below market expectations of 19.8 percent, as the economy gradually reopened. The number of unemployed persons fell by 2.1 million to 21.0 million as those who were on temporary layoff decreased by 2.7 million to 15.3 million. Among those not on temporary layoff, the number of permanent job losers increased by 295,000 to 2.3 million. The number of employed rose by 3.8 million to 137.2 million and the labor force participation rate increased to 60.8 percent, after hitting the lowest since January 1973 the month before. Since February, the unemployment rate was up by 9.8 percentage points and the number of unemployed persons increased by 15.2 million.

INTERNATIONAL TOURISM RECEIPTS COULD PLUNGE BY US$ 1 TRILLION

Tourism makes up some 10% of global GDP. It is estimated it provides 1 in 10 jobs. The potential impact of the pandemic on international tourism could be devastating due to which 100 to 120 million people who are directly involved in tourism could lose their jobs. **850 million to 1.1 billion** fewer international tourist arrivals are also expected next year due to which the tourism industry could suffer a loss of up to **US$ 1.2 trillion.**

📷

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the tourism industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as a slump in demand among travelers. The tourism industry has been massively affected by the spread of coronavirus, as many countries have introduced travel restrictions in an attempt to contain its spread\[1\]. The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 20–30% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$30–50 billion.\[2\] In many of the world’s cities, planned travel went down by 80–90%.\[3\] Many tourist attractions around the world, such as museums, amusement parks, and sports venues, are closed.

Retail sales among the hardest hit

Retail sales in the US sank 16.4 percent from a month earlier in April of 2020, worse than forecasts of a 12 percent drop. It is the sharpest decrease in retail sales ever due to the coronavirus pandemic which forced Americans to stay at home and many businesses to close. Biggest declines were seen in sales of clothing and accessories (-78.8 percent), electronics and appliances (-60.6 percent), and furniture (-58.7 percent). Sales at gasoline stations decreased 28.8 percent after oil prices turned negative for the first time ever in April. Other decreases were also seen in food and beverage stores (-13.1 percent) and food services and drinking places (-29.5 percent). Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales tumbled 15.3 percent. Year-on-year, retail sales went down 21.6 percent, also a record drop.

Business confidence reaches the lowest level since April of 2009

The ISM Manufacturing PMI for the US increased to 43.1 in May of 2020 from 41.5 in April which was the lowest reading since April of 2009. However, figures came below market forecasts of 43.6 and pointed to a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector. “The coronavirus pandemic impacted all manufacturing sectors for the third straight month. May appears to be a transition month, as many panelists and their suppliers returned to work late in the month. However, demand remains uncertain, likely impacting inventories, customer inventories, employment, imports, and a backlog of orders. Among the six biggest industry sectors, Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products remains the only industry in expansion. Transportation Equipment; Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; and Fabricated Metal Products continue to contract at strong levels,” says Fiore, Chair of the ISM.

Coronavirus stimulus just pushed Fed’s balance sheet past $6 trillion for the first time ever

The Fed has already injected more than $3 trillion into the economy since the pandemic has started in order to save the economy from complete collapse. Central Bank Balance Sheet in the United States increased to 7113208 USD Million on June 10 from 7101184 USD Million in the previous week. Wall Street now anticipates the balance sheet could hit $10 trillion this year as the Fed affirms its whatever-it-takes commitment to softening the coronavirus blow. Critics have worried about the possibility of inflation resulting from all that extra cash in the system, though it hasn’t been a problem since the asset purchases started in late 2008.

why the stock market is going up?

Although we have already entered the recession still we have witnessed an amazing rebound in the global equity market.S&amp;P 500 the index has rebounded from 2200 level and currently trading at 3036 levels but how this could happen that when everything is so awful the equity market is climbing? Here we need to keep in mind that markets are forward-looking and don’t work in present instead collective expectations about future events are integrated into the current level. Although march low was a great speculative buy one needs to keep in mind that the rally has been mostly dependent on the tech companies which has benefited a lot during the lockdown.FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google)). Currently, they constitute roughly 20% of the S&amp;P 500. we believe what we have seen was a classic bear market rally and the real decline hasn’t even started yet.

**Implications on Gold and Silver**

Gold has acted as a safe haven in these turbulent times and the yellow metal prices are signaling the critical issue that exists in the global economy. Gold performs well during times of political, geopolitical, and financial uncertainty. So far, it is living up to its expectations as gold is up 15.3% this year while the S&amp;P 500 is down 11.4%. Hedge funds are also adding significant portions of gold to there portfolios. We have also seen some large purchases by hedge funds in junior gold mining stocks. The gold market’s future looks bright as the global economy deals with unprecedented stimulus during a time of unprecedented uncertainty. We believe gold has a possibility to reach $2000 in upcoming months and the target for gold could be $1810.Silver has severely underperformed the gold since the rally in the precious metal sector has started but now it seems the white metal has started to follow gold however we are cautiously bullish on silver until it breaks above $18.20.After breaking out of $19 we could expect the substantial gain in the prices of silver. From a fundamental and technical perspective, we believe Gold, gold junior mining stocks, and selected crypto-assets should be preferred in the investment portfolio.",t2_6wm9szob,False,,0,False,Covid-19 Impact on Global Economy and Gold prices,[],r/Trading,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_hbdciv,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1592510765.0,text,6,,,text,self.Trading,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we are publishing this article gold is trading at $1730 however the white metal is hovering around $17.50 per ounce. It’s been around a month since we published our last research report(Gold was trading at $1672) when we tried to explain to you the key reasons why gold prices could explode. In this article, we would forecast the gold and silver prices for short as well as for the long term. enough talk now let’s get straight to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 45m people in the US have filed for unemployment benefits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;more than 45m people in the US have filed for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus outbreak has started which is about 30% of the workforce. The pandemic has led to an alarming surge in the losses of people jobs soaring the unemployment level to a post-World War II record high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent in May 2020 from 14.7% in April which was the largest in records back to 1939 and below market expectations of 19.8 percent, as the economy gradually reopened. The number of unemployed persons fell by 2.1 million to 21.0 million as those who were on temporary layoff decreased by 2.7 million to 15.3 million. Among those not on temporary layoff, the number of permanent job losers increased by 295,000 to 2.3 million. The number of employed rose by 3.8 million to 137.2 million and the labor force participation rate increased to 60.8 percent, after hitting the lowest since January 1973 the month before. Since February, the unemployment rate was up by 9.8 percentage points and the number of unemployed persons increased by 15.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERNATIONAL TOURISM RECEIPTS COULD PLUNGE BY US$ 1 TRILLION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tourism makes up some 10% of global GDP. It is estimated it provides 1 in 10 jobs. The potential impact of the pandemic on international tourism could be devastating due to which 100 to 120 million people who are directly involved in tourism could lose their jobs. &lt;strong&gt;850 million to 1.1 billion&lt;/strong&gt; fewer international tourist arrivals are also expected next year due to which the tourism industry could suffer a loss of up to &lt;strong&gt;US$ 1.2 trillion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the tourism industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as a slump in demand among travelers. The tourism industry has been massively affected by the spread of coronavirus, as many countries have introduced travel restrictions in an attempt to contain its spread[1]. The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 20–30% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$30–50 billion.[2] In many of the world’s cities, planned travel went down by 80–90%.[3] Many tourist attractions around the world, such as museums, amusement parks, and sports venues, are closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail sales among the hardest hit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail sales in the US sank 16.4 percent from a month earlier in April of 2020, worse than forecasts of a 12 percent drop. It is the sharpest decrease in retail sales ever due to the coronavirus pandemic which forced Americans to stay at home and many businesses to close. Biggest declines were seen in sales of clothing and accessories (-78.8 percent), electronics and appliances (-60.6 percent), and furniture (-58.7 percent). Sales at gasoline stations decreased 28.8 percent after oil prices turned negative for the first time ever in April. Other decreases were also seen in food and beverage stores (-13.1 percent) and food services and drinking places (-29.5 percent). Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales tumbled 15.3 percent. Year-on-year, retail sales went down 21.6 percent, also a record drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business confidence reaches the lowest level since April of 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISM Manufacturing PMI for the US increased to 43.1 in May of 2020 from 41.5 in April which was the lowest reading since April of 2009. However, figures came below market forecasts of 43.6 and pointed to a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector. “The coronavirus pandemic impacted all manufacturing sectors for the third straight month. May appears to be a transition month, as many panelists and their suppliers returned to work late in the month. However, demand remains uncertain, likely impacting inventories, customer inventories, employment, imports, and a backlog of orders. Among the six biggest industry sectors, Food, Beverage &amp;amp; Tobacco Products remains the only industry in expansion. Transportation Equipment; Petroleum &amp;amp; Coal Products; and Fabricated Metal Products continue to contract at strong levels,” says Fiore, Chair of the ISM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus stimulus just pushed Fed’s balance sheet past $6 trillion for the first time ever&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed has already injected more than $3 trillion into the economy since the pandemic has started in order to save the economy from complete collapse. Central Bank Balance Sheet in the United States increased to 7113208 USD Million on June 10 from 7101184 USD Million in the previous week. Wall Street now anticipates the balance sheet could hit $10 trillion this year as the Fed affirms its whatever-it-takes commitment to softening the coronavirus blow. Critics have worried about the possibility of inflation resulting from all that extra cash in the system, though it hasn’t been a problem since the asset purchases started in late 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why the stock market is going up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we have already entered the recession still we have witnessed an amazing rebound in the global equity market.S&amp;amp;P 500 the index has rebounded from 2200 level and currently trading at 3036 levels but how this could happen that when everything is so awful the equity market is climbing? Here we need to keep in mind that markets are forward-looking and don’t work in present instead collective expectations about future events are integrated into the current level. Although march low was a great speculative buy one needs to keep in mind that the rally has been mostly dependent on the tech companies which has benefited a lot during the lockdown.FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google)). Currently, they constitute roughly 20% of the S&amp;amp;P 500. we believe what we have seen was a classic bear market rally and the real decline hasn’t even started yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications on Gold and Silver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold has acted as a safe haven in these turbulent times and the yellow metal prices are signaling the critical issue that exists in the global economy. Gold performs well during times of political, geopolitical, and financial uncertainty. So far, it is living up to its expectations as gold is up 15.3% this year while the S&amp;amp;P 500 is down 11.4%. Hedge funds are also adding significant portions of gold to there portfolios. We have also seen some large purchases by hedge funds in junior gold mining stocks. The gold market’s future looks bright as the global economy deals with unprecedented stimulus during a time of unprecedented uncertainty. We believe gold has a possibility to reach $2000 in upcoming months and the target for gold could be $1810.Silver has severely underperformed the gold since the rally in the precious metal sector has started but now it seems the white metal has started to follow gold however we are cautiously bullish on silver until it breaks above $18.20.After breaking out of $19 we could expect the substantial gain in the prices of silver. From a fundamental and technical perspective, we believe Gold, gold junior mining stocks, and selected crypto-assets should be preferred in the investment portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most powerful components of short premium trades is the ability to adjust - keeping track of what we're doing is extremely important to make sure we're not making small mistakes along the way. 

Keeping track of adjustments is extremely important for identifying credit required for a profitable roll, when we're profitable on the rolled position, and how much risk is on the table. In the purest form, we need to track ALL debits out and ALL credits in. There are different account methods based on how folks treat credit collected, so we can modify our tracking to align with how we use the capital. 

Key inputs: Ticker, Trade Date, Expiry, Stock $, Strike, Premium Received 

With these we can calculate a bunch of helpful metrics: Adjusted Net Credit, ROC, %AR, B/E, Downside Protection, etc. However, no need to over-complicate it. As long as you track your adjusted net credit.

&lt;li&gt;Common things we can look for, debt levels, solvency, yield activity, earnings and revenue activity, as well history of payout. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reviewed XOM - as I came across during my Market Musings segment today. Not surprisingly, it violated nearly all the metrics I share in the bullet above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If things seem too good to be true, they typically are.&lt;/li&gt;

We have been able to observe a high correlation between SPX500 and Bitcoin during the first COVID-19 crash. SPX500, Bitcoin, and all other markets have been down by a lot and from then, Bitcoin was very correlated to SPX500.

Us markets started going down again, Bitcoin followed (he was also showing weaknesses).
US markets are now closed for the weekend, as usual. This could let Bitcoin going up for the next two days, and then touching these white boxes.
Like I said, Bitcoin is not bearish yet, we have not broken any support, neither broke the neutral zone on the 4h RSI (that held from the dip at 3800$).

This is why I think we could go up checking these white boxes if the bulls are willing to support prices.
And by supporting prices, I mean, prices are a reflection of how many buyers compared to sellers there are.
If there are more buyers than sellers, the price will go up.
So if the volume follows, a good buying volume, we'll see these white boxes checked.

You can also notice that the two highlighted patterns look similar. Price action looks the same and the RSI also looks the same.
Of course, it will not be the same forever, but this is good to keep this idea in mind.

I was discussing my general process and ended up doing a video to walk through it as well as some opportunities I see. Summary below:

1. I always start with reviewing my portfolio and making sure nothing is in need of immediate adjustments. Typically trades expiring soon, shorts that I want to take down for profits, etc. 
2. Next I make sure that my deltas haven't moved too extreme - we need to make sure our directional risk hasn't dramatically changed beyond our preferences. If so, delta adjustments are prudent here.
3. Finally the fun part! We get to go bargain shopping for things of interest. I tend to focus on products I favor to the long side vice short to take advantage of increased volatility. Absolutely similar to catching a falling knife, however I'm not concerned with how things do over the next week or two. I have a longer time-frame and only trade products that I'm willing to interact with for the next few months if adjustments are needed.

The next day i received an email saying that my positions where close to a margin call and if i wish to close my positions. I immediately closed all of them. Then i did some research that i should have done before i shorted these positions and started panicking when i realized that short means loaning the investment. So i never used the site again and disabled the advertising emails.

,Trading,"I’ve been receiving an increasing number of messages asking about my background, I generally duck these questions because I hate talking about myself. However, someone pointed out that it helps others connect with my progress. Here it goes. I’m 29 now, live in a $2mm house, have rental properties, am an active investor, angel investor, and title investor. My life didn’t start this way. I did not come from anything special - which is why I think this person wanted me to share my background. To show it’s possible for folks. I was an active Marine Officer for 5.5 years now in the reserves.

I started investing in high school (2007). I grew up with a single mom, alcoholic dad, and we lived very much paycheck time paycheck. I never wanted, always had a roof, food, and a loving mom. I was also taught that if someone called I didn’t know and asked for mom, she wasn’t home (debt collectors). 

I split wood as a kid and saved as much as I could. A mentor of mine suggested I looked into investing - suggesting that it would help me down the line. I looked into it and started an account under my dads name. I started with just long stock positions for about a year. 

I have an obsessive personality - once I find value in something I dig in. So once I started seeing my account grow, I chose to learn more. I got into derivatives and started to papertrade having a lot of issues with consistency. I took to Facebook to try and get help. Most folks made fun of me, a good amount wanted to sell me things, but a few didn’t. I still talk to these mentors today - without them, I wouldn’t be a successful trader

I worked with one mentor extensively. For hours on end trying to learn what I was doing. He was older, sarcastic, and pointed. A great teacher. After working with him for around a year, I started trading (2008 right before the drop). My account reduced by 67% but thanks to him, I didn’t make any rash decisions. We continued developing my trading plan and I closed out 2008 with a small loss, my only loss. Since then, I’ve been refining my plan and executing. My current CAGR is 19.44%, from 2007-2019. 

Now I started a YouTube channel to pay forward what my mentors did for me. I hope this answers the mail on my background - and more importantly allows others to know they can replicate what I’ve done. I’m not the brightest, have done nothing extraordinarily, but have worked hard to develop a plan and consistently execute. 

I’m hoping to continue interacting with folks and helping our community become more supportive of one another. Less aggressive and predatory. Here’s to hoping at least.

However, someone pointed out that it helps others connect with my progress. Here it goes. I’m 29 now, live in a $2mm house, have rental properties, am an active investor, angel investor, and title investor. My life didn’t start this way. I did not come from anything special - which is why I think this person wanted me to share my background. To show it’s possible for folks. I was an active Marine Officer for 5.5 years now in the reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started investing in high school (2007). I grew up with a single mom, alcoholic dad, and we lived very much paycheck time paycheck. I never wanted, always had a roof, food, and a loving mom. I was also taught that if someone called I didn’t know and asked for mom, she wasn’t home (debt collectors). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I split wood as a kid and saved as much as I could. A mentor of mine suggested I looked into investing - suggesting that it would help me down the line. I looked into it and started an account under my dads name. I started with just long stock positions for about a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an obsessive personality - once I find value in something I dig in. So once I started seeing my account grow, I chose to learn more. I got into derivatives and started to papertrade having a lot of issues with consistency. I took to Facebook to try and get help. Most folks made fun of me, a good amount wanted to sell me things, but a few didn’t. I still talk to these mentors today - without them, I wouldn’t be a successful trader&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"In 2019 Ferrari delivered 10,131 cars; more than ever before. Since Ferrari went public in 2015, the stock has been on a climb, rising 350% in the five years since IPO. The luxury market has historically been defensive towards market downturns, as was shown during the 2008 financial crisis, where Ferrari only lost about 7% of sales from 20008-2009. Relative to some other companies, RACE dipped only moderately as Italy bore the brunt of coronavirus but has since recovered to pre-corona highs after reopening in mid-May.

Ferrari is soon to transform into a massively high growth company. The company has announced a plethora of new cars, including a newly announced SUV. Previously, Ferrari strayed away from the SUV realm. However, new management at Ferrari sees vast potential in the SUV market. While the general auto market has seen a decline in output in the past years, the SUV market has seen immense growth. In 2014 SUVs represented 22.4% (16.66M) of the auto market compared to 36.4% (29.77M) in 2018. As Ferrari reaches into this new territory, they are destined to grow as demand for SUVs skyrockets.

In 2018 Ferrari announced an entirely new product line of cars in addition to their Sport/Special Series and GT series known as the Icona series. The Icona series went on sale in 2019 as a series of very unique limited edition cars that embrace the history of Ferrari. This limited series of cars his highly profitable due to the limited series and helped raise profits in 2019 and will continue to do so in the future.

Ferrari has also recently announced a new car that is more accessible to the general public known as the Ferrari Roma. This car is poised to offer competition towards offerings from Porsche for the first time. As Ferrari dives into more accessible pricing brackets, its brand recognition will help them grow immensely. Also, Ferrari has announced plans to enter the electric car market in 2025 and will undoubtedly have success due to the quality of the Ferrari brand. The new emphasis on electric cars comes in stark contrast to the Ferrari of just five years ago, which was uninterested in electric car development.

With 898 million euro in cash before 2019 and a 650 million euro debt offering released on May 21st, Ferrari has ample liquidity to weather any unforeseen economic downturns. With plants reopened following strict social distancing guidelines and cases in Italy trending lower and lower, Ferrari seems poised to rise over the long-term as they expand into more attractive and accessible market segments. Perhaps Ferrari will take over Porsche or Mercedes as the dominant luxury car manufacturer in the world.

,Trading,"I've heard many market pundits say ""the financial system is getting more chaotic - more volatile"", and while I agree that it FEELS that way, I would argue that they have simply become LESS RATIONAL.

Markets used to be driven by 20-30 key EXPERIENCED and KNOWLEDGEABLE ""Masters of the Universe"" and an army of MBAs. They would go to work, look at the news - make decisions about what that means for ""the Markets"" - and ACT in a rational way.

Now, the Market is run by boys and girls that managed to parlay the $20 they stole from their Mom's purse into $2,000 simply by downloading an app, typing ""what should I buy"" into the echo chamber that is WSB/etc - and riding the inevitable trend. A monkey could literally achieve the same results.

How did they do it? They don't know. And like Eamon and ""I don't Want You Back"" - bitches are one hit wonders.

The OTHER HALF (or more) of the Markets, these days - is driven by Computers. Systems designed implicitly to soak pennies out of WHATEVER direction the Market is going - not terribly different than the kiddies with apps.

,Trading,"Hi

I’m new to trading and would appreciate some advice on a recent matter. 

I placed a pending order out of market hours to buy 3 separate stocks. As soon as the market opened all three stocks shot up through the roof and my pending orders triggered at the top of the spikes, much higher than the price I had set and agreed to pay. 

My question is, does the trading platform have the right/authority to do this? Surely if the trade cannot be completed at the price I’ve set, for whatever reason, then the order should be cancelled? 

Obviously, due to this I am now largely in the red. I need to know if I have an argument to fight this or if I’m wasting my time? 

Thank you in advance!

,Trading,"I recently got a question on the concept of edge and how we create it is traders. Edge does exist, we know from empirical research. We also know it's elusive. I made a video outlining my approach to developing edge as a trader and reviewed a study (from 2017) regarding day trading "" Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?"" In short, our long term profitability depends on our capacity to develop an edge.

Below is a summary of what I covered in the video:

\- We need a detailed understanding of the market we're trading. Don't spread yourself too thin trying to trade everything. Don't narrow yourself too much either. Fine what works for you.

\- Structure positively expectant trades. Many trades by nature are not positively expectant and need management applied.

\- Document experience to increase pattern recognition. (This is empirical, not Erik's opinion)

\- Control variables. We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails. Leverage your trading plan to analyze what you're doing and make minor adjustments as needed. Observe, document, and adjust again as necessary.

Below is the conclusion of the study | link: [https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf)

"" We test predictions of models of learning by rational traders and find clear evidence that the decision to continue or increase day trading is influenced by previous day trading returns. Nevertheless, rational models of learning do not explain all or even most day trading. The most experienced day traders lose money and nearly 3/4ths of day trading can be traced to traders with a history of losses. Persistent trading in the face of losses is inconsistent with models of rational learning. So, too, is the decision to try day trading when ex-ante expected lifetime profits are negative. For prospective day traders, “trading to learn” is no more rational or profitable than playing roulette to learn. ""

,Trading,"Last week Boeing announced they were going to be laying off 6,770 employees as part of the first wave of involuntary layoffs. This reduction in staff may seem to be a significant negative for Boeing and indeed, is a large negative for the short-term investor. However, in the long-term, this layoff (in combination with voluntary layoffs last month) will allow Boeing to emerge from this downturn as a more efficient company as the company focuses on profits during this difficult time.

Also, last week, we learned that Boeing had reached a significant milestone regarding the over a yearlong 737 MAX grounding as they resumed aircraft production. Boeing has begun production of this aircraft, albeit at a shallow rate, focusing on methodologies to enhance quality and plans to ramp production this year. As the 737 MAX is a significant source of revenue and profit for Boeing, the resumption of production is a sign that recertification is on the horizon.

Over the last two days, the stock has seen substantial gains driven by news that airlines are finally on the upswing as more people are flying in comparison to the lows reached last month. However, even in light of substantial gains, the stock remains 40% off pre-corona highs, and over 50% from all-time highs reached in mid-2019. With Boeing gaining $25 billion from one of the most extensive debt offerings in history, they will have access to plenty of funds to withstand this downturn with no government aid.

As production of the 737 MAX continues, and Boeing becomes more efficient from an employment perspective, Boeing is positioned to become even more valuable than before this pandemic.

Gamestop, despite speculation that digital sales have driven stronger-than-expected earnings (in light of in-store sales tanking), will miss expectations.\n2. Gamestop's digital sales will prove to be a short-term saving grace for the company, driving an earnings beat but a less-than optimistic forward guidance for the remainder of the year.\n3. Gamestop's digital sales will prove to be a short-term saving grace for the company, driving an earnings beat and greater forward guidance for the upcoming console cycle.\n4. Gamestop will crush earnings with their spike in digital sales, improve forward guidance and expectations for the console cycle, and potentially have laid the framework for their 2.0 business model.\n\nBased on earnings estimates, it is more likely than not that Gamestop will either miss the high bar set by analysts following their spike in digital sales (1) or beat earnings with no significant improvement in full-year guidance (2). In both of these scenarios, there is significant downside that has followed the stock quarter to quarter the last few years. If Gamestop can somehow leverage the COVID pandemic to create the necessary foundation for their revised business model, this earnings report could result in the short-squeeze bulls have been speculating about since January (current short float of 96.8%), but it is less than likely.\n\nOverall, considering that any sales boost resulting from COVID has been eagerly priced into earnings, there is significant short-term downside to $GME. We saw in early April that Gamestop is capable of dipping below $3."", 'author_fullname': 't2_6788o5ac', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': '[$GME] [6/5/20] ""Despite Gamestop\'s irrationality over the last 6 months, there is rationality to the likelihood of a continued short-term decline.""', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/WallStreetIdeas', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': None, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_gx19ea', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 3, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 3, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1591377665.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': None, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.WallStreetIdeas', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, earnings have not been kind to Gamestop, and their upcoming report on June 28th is no exception.

I believe that the halls of power, especially of this administration, are laden with large institutional investors who at times seem to work as an extension of the Fed. (Blackstone).

It's not a secret that the hottest trade for Institutions over the course of the low interest oughts, has been the Carry Trade. 

A trade that works just fine if the Home currency goes down, but gets all but wiped out if it goes up against the carried currency.

Carry Trades are implicitly tied to debt. Almost every crisis we have surrounds debt in some way - its why the Fed focuses on QE and the like.

But you can protect debt 2 important ways right now: buy debt on the market, and make sure the existing debt doesn't default.

If the Fed and major Institutions worked together they could (and in my opinion have) artificially hold down the Dollar, even in the midst of a crisis that calls for all a crash, and a dollar surge.

I was reading about oil futures speculation and was wondering if anyone could clarify my understanding of the two below points. I’m not looking to trade oil futures at the moment. 

1) Is the price difference from which money is made from when the value of a contract increases due to the underlying price of oil increasing, then this is sold before the maturity to gain the difference? As I understand this, the original contracts terms (such as the price which the seller is guaranteed to receive) will remain the same, and the clearing house will credit the buyer if the price increased. 

2) Although when speculating there is only a cash settlement meaning no physical delivery of oil, what happens to the underlying oil itself at maturity? I know opposite contracts can cancel themselves out, but I assume some contracts mature without cancellation.

,Trading,"Hi all, I just started swing trading two weeks ago (been investing for about 2 years), up about 12% but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just getting lucky without doing my due diligence so I was wondering if I could get some advice. My timeline for swing trading is anywhere from 1 day to 1 month and I don’t plan on shorting any time soon until I get more comfortable. I’m also targeting up to 5 trades a week, but this week I did 4 and last week was 2.

Here’s my procedure:

1. Typicalily, I would look at a particular sector, see what the trend is, and then pick high volume/low cost stocks, usually blue chips/mid-cap/growth stocks.
2. Once I find a stock, I look at the 1D, 2D, 5D, 10D, 1M charts to identify potential buying points, comparing them with past data to see likelihood. I use 50EMA, 200SMA, RSI, ADX and MACD for my indicators to help with making that call. I do some news research as well, but I place most of my time on the technicals.
3. Once I determine an entry point, I punch in the number of shares I can buy at the buy price in my spreadsheet and it spits out stop losses (-1% of total portfolio value PV) and target sells (+3% of PV). These are computed based on the PV at the time and whatever that % is, I divide by the number of shares to get the change which I can use to determine the stop loss and target sell. So for example, let’s say I have $100 and I want to buy 20 shares of a stock that costs $1. My stop loss would be at $0.95 (1% PV loss is $1 so if I have 20 shares and price goes down to $0.95, then I’m at a loss of 1% overall); my target sell would be computed similarly except +3%.
4. Once I hit 3%, I would sell. I don’t think I would sell if there is a price drop, I’d probably hold for however long it takes to get back to stop loss or original buy price unless there is news that suggests a potential rally.

I get that as my portfolio gets larger, so too would the stop loss and target sell prices but I would be able to compensate for that by buying more shares/cheaper stocks.

I’m also having trouble pulling the trigger on trades so if there’s anything else I should be doing, I would appreciate the advice!

Thanks!

Is this acceptable? How do you guys come up with the idea to trade a particular stock?",t2_dmmr2,False,,0,False,Trading Strategy,[],r/Trading,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_gt9527,False,dark,1.0,,public,15,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,15,,False,self,1590856306.0,,[],{},,True,,1590846983.0,text,6,,,text,self.Trading,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I just started swing trading two weeks ago (been investing for about 2 years), up about 12% but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just getting lucky without doing my due diligence so I was wondering if I could get some advice. My timeline for swing trading is anywhere from 1 day to 1 month and I don’t plan on shorting any time soon until I get more comfortable. I’m also targeting up to 5 trades a week, but this week I did 4 and last week was 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typicalily, I would look at a particular sector, see what the trend is, and then pick high volume/low cost stocks, usually blue chips/mid-cap/growth stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I find a stock, I look at the 1D, 2D, 5D, 10D, 1M charts to identify potential buying points, comparing them with past data to see likelihood. I use 50EMA, 200SMA, RSI, ADX and MACD for my indicators to help with making that call. I do some news research as well, but I place most of my time on the technicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I determine an entry point, I punch in the number of shares I can buy at the buy price in my spreadsheet and it spits out stop losses (-1% of total portfolio value PV) and target sells (+3% of PV). These are computed based on the PV at the time and whatever that % is, I divide by the number of shares to get the change which I can use to determine the stop loss and target sell. So for example, let’s say I have $100 and I want to buy 20 shares of a stock that costs $1. My stop loss would be at $0.95 (1% PV loss is $1 so if I have 20 shares and price goes down to $0.95, then I’m at a loss of 1% overall); my target sell would be computed similarly except +3%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I hit 3%, I would sell. I don’t think I would sell if there is a price drop, I’d probably hold for however long it takes to get back to stop loss or original buy price unless there is news that suggests a potential rally.&lt;/li&gt;

For instance, in a green candle, price could have opened, increased to the candle high, decreased down to the candle low, and then rebounded to the level it closed at. Or it could have done the opposite - first opened, then decreased to the low, increased to the high, and then closed.

Since candlestick charts are so ubiquitously used among traders, does it matter that we don't know the chronological story of price action within the time period of a given candle (1M, 5M, Daily charts) when reading a chart?

,Trading,"CFD providers are reporting a significant increase in new clients because of Covid-19. Whilst most seasoned traders understand the difference between DMA (Direct Market Access) and Market Maker pricing, I'm sure many have opened accounts with the likes of CMC Markets, City Index and IG Markets without reading the PDS (Product Disclosure Statement).

A CFD or Contract for Difference is an agreement between you and your provider to exchange the difference in price of an asset between when the contract is opened and when it is closed. The CFD product is simple to understand and offers considerable amounts of leverage enabling traders to take out positions much larger than if you purchased the underlying product.

Now in the beginning, CFD providers charged a fee for opening and closing a position in exactly the same way a broker would charge in order to buy and sell ordinary equities. If you wanted access to live prices, you needed to pay an exchange fee.

As CFDs became more popular, CFD providers began innovating the product in order to generate profit. The providers decided to enter into agreements with real banks and financial institutions in order to hedge their exposure and make more money by taking the opposite position to what was being traded.

This still wasn't enough for CFD providers who again changed the product by charging a spread (the difference between the buy price and sell price). The major banks / financial institutions who partnered with the CFD provider in order to hedge were not charged a spread.

This, again, was still not enough for many providers. 

CFD providers began the unthinkable and decided to charge their own price for the underlying instrument! This meant that it was now possible for providers to not only take the opposite sides of the buy / sell price using liquidity partners, but also adjust the price of the CFD to any amount they want. It was now possible to increase the price of a CFD trade to a level high / low enough to hit your stop losses before adjusting it back to whatever the market price was. 

I would consider the above to constitute fraud if it wasn't so clearly described in their Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), a document that obviously many people do not read.

**DMA CFDs**

DMA (Direct Market Access) CFD providers offer a much, much better product. Upon placing an order, the provider typically places the same order into the underlying market. The prices quoted are the same as the underlying and you can even see your trade in the order book. 

Most DMA CFD providers charge:

1. Minimum Deposit
2. Platform Fee
3. Exchange Data Fee
4. A fee to buy / sell

In my opinion, I would much rather pay the fees quoted if it meant I was actually trading the financial markets instead of a price that can be changed in order to close out my positions at a loss whenever the computers at CMC feel like it.

**DMA CFD Providers**

Some DMA CFD providers include:

Whilst most seasoned traders understand the difference between DMA (Direct Market Access) and Market Maker pricing, I&amp;#39;m sure many have opened accounts with the likes of CMC Markets, City Index and IG Markets without reading the PDS (Product Disclosure Statement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CFD or Contract for Difference is an agreement between you and your provider to exchange the difference in price of an asset between when the contract is opened and when it is closed. The CFD product is simple to understand and offers considerable amounts of leverage enabling traders to take out positions much larger than if you purchased the underlying product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in the beginning, CFD providers charged a fee for opening and closing a position in exactly the same way a broker would charge in order to buy and sell ordinary equities. If you wanted access to live prices, you needed to pay an exchange fee.&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hi Reddit

I'm a Day Trader of 15 years. I trade primarily futures contracts and ordinary equities.

I am asked the same question repeatedly - What do I need in order to become successful?

**Capital**

You need at least $100,000.00 in order to have any chance of becoming a successful trader. You will need to understand that this money is not for investing or trading, it's for educational purposes. Many people spend circa $100,000 on university degrees in order to learn specific skillsets that may or may not be relevant to what you would like to do / become.

**Time**

You need to be willing to spend at least 12 hours of work every trading day. Here is my schedule:

6:00 am: Wake up, have coffee whilst watching the close of the US markets.

7:00 am: Shower, read the Australian Financial Review online.

8:00 am: I begin planning.

9:00 am: I switch on my computer and ensure my internet connection is working by conducting a speed test. I ensure there are no pending Windows Updates and begin opening software and apps.

9:30 am: I finish my planning and begin preparing for the open.

9:50 am: I start generating trade ideas.

10:00am: The ASX opens.

4:00pm: The ASX closes.

5:00pm: I take a look at what positions I've got open, what positions I've got closed and allow myself 30 minutes to rest and recover.

6:00pm: I journal, might write a blog and try to switch off.

6:00pm - 6:00 am: During my down-time I'm still always connected to the markets. My phone provides live notifications.

10:00pm: I take a look at the futures market and watch a little bit of the financial news / television.

11:00pm: I should be asleep - if I'm not asleep either something major is happening overseas or I haven't taken enough Xanax.

**Equipment**

You will need the fastest internet you can find. If you are using WiFi in order to trade, you haven't done your homework. Make sure you have a contingency plan for when your internet goes down.

Get the fastest laptop you can afford! You will need a laptop over a desktop so that when the power goes out you can still access the markets. Don't buy an Apple product - get a Lenovo ThinkPad.

**Broker**

Finding the right broker takes time. I personally have around 5 accounts open with different brokers as each tends to specialise in a specific market.

Your broker should offer you either a free demonstration account or at the very least some sort of training.

In Australia, we have what is called a Product Disclosure Statement or PDS. A PDS contains crucial information regarding the terms and conditions of your account. You should absolutely read the PDS and study it prior to opening a position. I personally have been burned twice now because I failed to read the PDS with a critical mindset and had a different definition to my broker as to what constituted the price of an instrument.

**Mindset**

Trading the financial markets is open to anyone. You will get burned repeatedly - even by your broker. You are a retail day trader at the very bottom of the food chain. Any trade you make that becomes profitable in the first 4 years is a miracle and should be treated as such.

Becoming a successful, profitable Day Trader requires the same amount of education, practical experience and time as that of any other professional in any other industry. Trading attracts the brightest, smartest, most intelligent of people. Generally speaking, these people get snapped up by the very companies you will be trading against. You need to be the best, the top 1% in order to succeed.

**Bloomberg Professional**

As a newbie, you won't be able to afford this and that is OK. But you should be working towards getting a terminal in your home office.

Having a Bloomberg Professional subscription changed the way I thought about and traded the markets. You will gain access to the same data, at the same time as most Wall Street firms. You will be connected to and able to chat with the biggest players in the financial markets.

I view the $24,000 a year + exchange data as being an ""entry fee"". I cannot really trade without it.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a Day Trader of 15 years. I trade primarily futures contracts and ordinary equities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am asked the same question repeatedly - What do I need in order to become successful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need at least $100,000.00 in order to have any chance of becoming a successful trader. You will need to understand that this money is not for investing or trading, it&amp;#39;s for educational purposes. Many people spend circa $100,000 on university degrees in order to learn specific skillsets that may or may not be relevant to what you would like to do / become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be willing to spend at least 12 hours of work every trading day. Here is my schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:00 am: Wake up, have coffee whilst watching the close of the US markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:00 am: Shower, read the Australian Financial Review online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:00 am: I begin planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:00 am: I switch on my computer and ensure my internet connection is working by conducting a speed test. I ensure there are no pending Windows Updates and begin opening software and apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:30 am: I finish my planning and begin preparing for the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:50 am: I start generating trade ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:00am: The ASX opens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:00pm: The ASX closes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:00pm: I take a look at what positions I&amp;#39;ve got open, what positions I&amp;#39;ve got closed and allow myself 30 minutes to rest and recover.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last few years, he's started to trade a pretty big book made up of mainly family friends and crypto connections. All in about $1m. So far, he's built his edge to be pretty directional where he earns alpha on both up and down cycles. I'm guessing he's done quite well since he has about $25m committed and another $20m to call in over the next few months. He's offered me a seat to trade on behalf of his fund and I'm a little unsure.

To give some background, I've accepted a quant trading offer at a HF focused on energy markets which I'm supposed to start in about a month. My background is in math and machine learning. 

Obviously, the upside to this opportunity is quite big as I'd be one of the first traders in a startup HF, however, there is a fair amount of risk as it'd be a fund founded by people in their 20's who haven't traded through major recessions/corrections and are less equipped to navigate the impending recession that we will face. Given that they have $20m called in, I have confidence that they have a Strat thats profitable and proprietary but I realize that they're trading against top quant funds who most likely understand the market better.

But I think there is a competitive advantage to be had, somewhere, someway. Right? Markets cannot be 100% efficient: dissemination of information is not perfect. What if then, we could attempt to find this competitive advantage. We could backtrack to previous earnings, evaluate current earnings, and screen across different fundamentals to see if there are any discernible trends. What could go wrong.\n\nSo, I sought to ignorantly invest in all companies reporting earnings over the week of 5/11 to 5/15, and evaluate whether there were any interesting insights we could come up with.\n\n# Methodology:\n\nAs you can tell from the title, this post is Part 1 of an ongoing series of posts, week to week, evaluating earnings under this lens. With this being said, the methodology I use in this first week is...primitive (to say the least) but will be refined week to week, targeting an end goal of identifying an observable trend.\n\n1. **Timeline.** For this report, I will be evaluating earnings reports covering the trading week beginning 5/11 and ending 5/15. In the future, I plan on backtesting previous weeks once we\'ve refined our methodology. For the time being, we will be forward looking.\n2. **What Earnings to ""Play?""** For this analysis, I will be referencing earningswhispers.com\'s ""**Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the trading week beginning \\[insert Monday of chosen week\\]""** earnings calendar. If you aren\'t familiar with r/EarningsWhispers, they create weekly earnings ""calendars"" that detail popular companies\' earnings reports for a given week, organized based on date and time of release (before market open or after market close). Having worked in-depth with their calendars while setting up this analysis, I feel that their calendars represent a solid mixture of companies, specifically diverse in risk (value/growth), market capitalization (large/small/micro), and sectors, and industries. For this report, I will be referencing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWhispers/comments/gghsn7/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the/) earnings calendar. If there are any recommendations for services with more comprehensive report coverage, please let me know.\n3. **Investment Size.** To ensure that we were able to buy into all companies (no matter how high their share price was), I designated $1000 per investment. I tested again using $100 per investment, and the percentage difference was negligible. Besides, with fractional shares accessible on major platforms, investment size is less about concern and more about standardizing the return % we get.\n4. **Security of Choice and Holding Period.** For my first iteration of this project, I decided to invest using common stocks instead of options. Although options are the go-to choice for playing earnings, I figured starting with fewer variables, i.e. common stocks, would be a good foundation. Later on, I\'d be interested in redoing these scenarios with options. For each stocks\' holding period, I chose a 24-hour timeframe in order to minimize non-earnings influences. My rationale was as follows. For BO stock, purchasing the stock at close the day before the pre-market earnings release would reasonably approximate the markets anticipation of earnings pre-market and reaction to earnings through the following trading day, eliminating the impact of non-earnings news as much as possible. I applied this same rationale to the AO stock, however it is more difficult to approximate because the market\'s accessibility to anticipation/reaction prices is flipped: anticipation for a BO stock is purely institutional investors (while reaction comes from the broader market) while anticipation for an AO stock comes from the broader market (while the subsequent reaction following earnings is from after-hours trading). Being said, I\'m considering playing around with different holding periods to more efficiently block out non-earnings movement and encompass earnings movement. If you have any suggestions, drop below. The investment schedule is as follows (modeling the beginning of the week):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5/8/20 4:00 PM - Purchased BO Stock\n\n5/11/20 9:30 AM - Purchased AO Stock\n\n5/11/20 4:00PM - Sold BO Stock\n\n5/12/20 9:30AM - Sold AO Stock\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReiterating above, this methodology is very basic, but will be improved as we go forward. From the below results, I already have a few interesting ideas for future earnings investments, including: purchasing based on P/E versus industry P/E, sector, revisions in last 30 days, RSI, 72 hour holding period, etc.\n\n# Data:\n\n|Date|Before Market Return|After Market Return|Total Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5/11|(-$229/$8934): -2.56%|($1381/$9816): 14.1%|($1152/$18571): 6%|\n|5/12|(-$277/$9880): -2.81%|(-$226/$8881): -2.54%|(-$503/$18761): -2.6%|\n|5/13|($650/$8951): 7.26%|($-531/$8808): -6.02%|($119/$17760): 0.6%|\n|5/14|($360/$9791): 3.69%|($975/$8870): 11%|($1336/$18662): 7.1%|\n|5/15|(-$98/$8953): 1.00%|N/A|(-$98/$8953): 1.00%|\n|Total|||($2006/$82887): 2.40%|\n|Total|**DOW:** \\-2.30%|**SPY:** \\-1.50%|**Earnings:** 2.40%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Date|Largest BM Mover|Largest AM Mover|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|5/11|\\-9.7% ($UAA)|96.97% ($NVAX)|\n|5/12|20.3% ($NSPR), -19.32% ($CSPR)|28.37% ($ISR)|\n|5/13|35% ($EFOI)|\\-20% ($SDC)|\n|5/14|25.3% ($ETM)|49.1% ($ACB)|\n|5/15|15.5% ($DKNG)|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Positive Gains|Negative Gains|Neutral Gains|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|40|43|2|\n\n# Results:\n\nDespite the fact that our earnings investments outperformed the market last week, there are a few anomalies to account for. Most importantly, the average positive gain was larger than the average negative gain. Despite the fact there were more negative gains, positive gains usually sent the stock proportionally higher. This is demonstrated through major movers like $NVAX and $ACB, which made up 73% ($1450/$2006) of total gains for the week. As I continue to comb through the results, I will update this section of the post. If you find anything interesting, please comment and I will add it.\n\nIf you would like to see the raw data, the spreadsheet is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wIfzRnjqUy6_xfuecrfECEskgLy1UcAG8KrmaZH-DJA/edit?usp=sharing).

This is demonstrated through major movers like $NVAX and $ACB, which made up 73% ($1450/$2006) of total gains for the week.

This supports the thesis that the upside of a positive earnings response is greater than the downside of a negative earnings response.\n\n\\-Despite the fact the earnings return underperformed the broader market 2 of the 5 weeks (4/13 + 4/20), the earnings returns were never negative (albeit it got close 4/27). This supports the thesis that the optimism surrounding companies\' earnings acts as a hedge against broader market unfavorability.\n\n\\-As was brought to my attention in my last post, because the holding period for each stock is no more than 24 hours, in future posts total earnings returns will need to be discounted for capital gains taxes. This demonstrates the advantage of passive indexing + not having to worry about often turnover. I believe that even considering capital gains, the earnings results of the last 5 weeks will still outperform the broader markets, but we will see in the next post.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Applying Our Methodology to Low-Beta Companies + Going Forward**\n\nThe last few weeks of research have led me to believe that putting together a formal investment vehicle for this methodology, such as an ETF, would be difficult considering the lack of upside potential residing in fundamentally proven companies. ETFs that focus on trading within the S&amp;P or DOW are inherently disadvantaged from a return perspective. But I would argue that under the right portfolio formation (following the diversified earnings schedule we\'ve followed the last 5 weeks), we can sustain an outperformance of the broader market over the long term.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I will apply this methodology to the current 505 companies in the S&amp;P, going from 2008 to 2019. This will be the subject matter of my next post (along with continued backtesting on the ""most anticipated earnings"" investment approach). In anticipation of conducting this research, I chose $WYNN (which has been in the S&amp;P since 2008) to experiment with returns. As the results show (fair warning, this is 1 of 505 companies. extrapolating from this is ignorant on my part), there is legitimacy to the argument that attempting to apply this earnings report methodology to low-beta companies will NOT outperform the market.\n\n**$WYNN Returns (10/29/08 to 5/9/19)**\n\n||Earnings|S&amp;P|DOW|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Return|123.60% (not including capital gains)|213.55%|176.98%|\n|Annualized Return|11.18%|||\n|Average Earnings Movement|1.796%|||\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ikkxjrtz0wXacKfyPvIPcHQ0LihCkJv-nu1Q1s-2Yos/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a preliminary test, this reflects poorly on the potential of applying this methodology to the S&amp;P and DOW. It very well may be that $WYNN is an exception: we will see next week.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, a lot of the information discovered so far is a generous extrapolation. But we are objectively getting closer to clear answers regarding how this methodology may perform over the long-term. Over the next few weeks, we will be working on filling in the S&amp;P\'s returns from \'08 to \'19 using this methodology, along with applying this methodology to ""anticipated earnings releases"" over an extended period of time as we\'ve done for the last five weeks.\n\nAs always, please let me know what you think!', 'author_fullname': 't2_6788o5ac', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Playing the Earnings Calendar: An Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing [Pt.2: Multi-Week Returns + Unique Insights]', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/wallstreetbets', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 0, 'link_flair_css_class': 'dd', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_go7y81', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'upvote_ratio': 0.9, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 41, 'total_awards_received': 1, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'DD', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 41, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_1': 1}, 'post_hint': 'self', 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1590132795.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 0, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.wallstreetbets', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Playing the Earnings Calendar: An Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing [Pt.2: Multi-Week Returns + Unique Insights]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl464q/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I laid the foundation for the &amp;quot;Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing&amp;quot; project, where we ignorantly invest in earnings, with well-defined conditions under a well-defined time period, and evaluate the returns.

As the results show (fair warning, this is 1 of 505 companies. extrapolating from this is ignorant on my part), there is legitimacy to the argument that attempting to apply this earnings report methodology to low-beta companies will NOT outperform the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$WYNN Returns (10/29/08 to 5/9/19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Earnings&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;S&amp;amp;P&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;DOW&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Return&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;123.60% (not including capital gains)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;213.55%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;176.98%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Annualized Return&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;11.18%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Average Earnings Movement&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.796%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ikkxjrtz0wXacKfyPvIPcHQ0LihCkJv-nu1Q1s-2Yos/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a preliminary test, this reflects poorly on the potential of applying this methodology to the S&amp;amp;P and DOW.

But we are objectively getting closer to clear answers regarding how this methodology may perform over the long-term. Over the next few weeks, we will be working on filling in the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s returns from &amp;#39;08 to &amp;#39;19 using this methodology, along with applying this methodology to &amp;quot;anticipated earnings releases&amp;quot; over an extended period of time as we&amp;#39;ve done for the last five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, please let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'preview': {'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cmLH5_KhNpwuUXn0_L5DIhSm5epCL070q6Txqz5c5Ro.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=27cae616f896fab4438f69a43f28967881f190c7', 'width': 192, 'height': 192}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cmLH5_KhNpwuUXn0_L5DIhSm5epCL070q6Txqz5c5Ro.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a59d442517fe2a7de37b209f6f0f99373690086f', 'width': 108, 'height': 108}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'zcxtbc2oJ6aU3Oi_qaGrQRE7Yp7xzBH4hoZq-RlMgdA'}], 'enabled': False}, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 100, 'resized_tier_icons': None, 'id': 'gid_1', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'static_icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': ""Shows the Silver Award... and that's it."", 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'name': 'Silver', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '5692ce02-b860-11e5-b542-0edc7016bbd3', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2th52', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#365b8c', 'id': 'go7y81', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'imattractedtodcfs', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 16, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1459084, 'created_utc': 1590103995.0, 'num_crossposts': 6, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/,t3_go7y81

Obviously CUK is good. Normally the price hovers around $40, but it dropped to around $11 since the quarantine started, halting all cruise ships. I have a $16 call for September, when they are expected to open back up.

F, price got cut in half, went from 10 a share to $5 a share. $6 call for june. Obviously once they start making cars/selling them itll go up, like all of these though it's just a question of when.

SPG is another good one. Normally $120, currently $55. $110 call for Jan 2021 They deal with real estate for things like malls, outlets, etc. Most malls around the country are opening up, once that happens I expect a lot more to come.

,Trading,"**DAY AHEAD**

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:**

&lt;p&gt;In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.&lt;/p&gt;

So, apparently offshore Forex broker have an algorithm that take the opposite trade of theirs clients. When the client take a buy order, the broker take a sell order, when the client close the buy order, broker close the sell order. Knowing that more than 95% of Trader loose theirs money on the long term, offshore broker earn a lot of money just by doing that, and that why they don't care about giving clients small commission and small spread, because theirs get rich just by taking opposite trade.

Greetings,

Thank you for getting in touch with us.

I was able to review the case in-depth and it does appear that the loss was caused by the market opening with a gap, thus executing the order at the price of 36.65, which is the opening market price.

I would be glad if I was able to shed some light on the situation.

In case you would need further assistance, do not hesitate to contact us.

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price. 

I hope this information dispels any concerns you may have. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, check out our Help Centre or reach our team 24/7.

,Trading,"Hi guys.

I've been reading up a lot on EM sovereigns CDS spreads. So far the established facts are:
1. EM CDS spreads move in tandem more often than not. There are significant correlations between CDS spreads of geographically similarly situated countries
2. These CDS spreads are moved more by global factors than they are by the local markets of each sovereign.
3. There is a significant correlation between EM CDS and the SP500 and VIX.

However, these are already established facts in any EM trader's mind. Furthermore, the correlations are calculated from coincident CDS and equities time series. So the analysis does not help with pre-empting a CDS spread move and putting a trade on.

Is there any leading indicator for CDS spreads besides an obvious and worst-case scenario like a ""We might default or daily to pay on our debt"" call by the sovereign?

,Trading," 

It's common for writers to scream *Bear!* using all sorts of fancy technical analysis and be wrong for months on end only to re-write their article and cry wolf again until eventually they are right. I prefer to follow the trend into resistance levels and size down for safety until the next trend is established. It's a far more patient trade plan, but it pays in profit and in lack of stress trying to chase micro-moves.

Yesterday, September 2nd, 2020 I was glancing at the SPY (S&amp;P 500 etf) daily and weekly chart to check just how far out of wack the markets were being. Within a few moments, it was clear there was a trend line that formed on major resistance points. After seeing this resistance and the current state of the market, I knew it was time to size down. I knew the trades could easily keep going, but I had a trade plan that I've relied on for years and wasn't going to stop now.

Here's the mention and chart of SPY on September 2nd...

[https://imgur.com/a/mbGJdiP](https://imgur.com/a/mbGJdiP)

I sized down a few of my bullish trades that were in profit and very tech focused. I had been closing some of my September 18th expiration option spreads for some time, but missed out on a decent amount of profit to play safe and had to suppress want to go back and look at how much I had missed out on despite making nearly 10% on the account in the month. Again... following the trade plan is the easiest way to avoid the emotional pitfalls that traders often fall back into before blowing up a large portion or all of their account.

After opening up the charts again this morning September 3rd, 2020 to my amazement, the timing was near perfect.

Now most traders would go back to their alert and scream *I'm a genius! Look at this!* However, we know that trading is a game of probability and that we really may be fooled by randomness so I cannot and will not take credit for being lucky with timing. What we can hypothesize from this action in the markets is that buyers are now concerned which can lead way to a further bearish movement over the next few weeks to a few months.

With the rise of no-commission retail brokers, the number of people who don’t truly know what they’re doing keeps increasing. In this article, I want to efficiently explain how simple it is to calculate net debit option positions so we can become smarter traders.

**Top Watch:**

As discussed in the past two articles, INTC has been our top watch for a bullish move above $52. On Thursday and Friday of last week, we entered October 18th expiration options on INTC with strike prices of 50 and 55. For simplicity, I would love to have these orders as single contracts, but the images of orders and charts I want to use require us to use actual order sizes so we’ll add a bit of extra math. Another note is that 1 contract is equal to 100 shares so a premium of $1.00 is $1x100 shares = $100.00

BTO (Buy to open) 50 strike calls @ $1.90 X 20 contracts = $3800 cost  
BTO (Buy to open) 55 strike calls @ $0.61 X 40 contracts = $2440 cost

Total cost = $6240  
Max Loss = $6240  
Max Profit = Unlimited

The risk profile is as shown where the break even price for INTC at expiration is $53.20 as shown by the pink tick mark. In order for this position to profit, it needs to move bullish before expiration or the contract decay, known as theta, will remove value from the position.

[https://imgur.com/a/JYRmReJ](https://imgur.com/a/JYRmReJ)

In the time since opening the trade and now, the price of INTC increased by roughly $1.50 and our position is now into profit. There are three educated choices we can make.

1. Do nothing. This is always an option until expiration when the market demands a decision.  
2. Take profit by closing the position.  
3. Adjust these call options into an option spread.

In this case, choice 3 is where I decided to focus and unfortunately the most complicated choice. I decide to use the 55 strike call options to pay for my spread… Let me explain.

STC (Sell to close) 55 strike calls @ $0.88 per contract X 40 contracts = $3520  
This closes our 55 strike calls for a profit of $3520-2440 = $1080 and that is rolled into the cost of our STO 52.5 calls as shown below.

STO (Sell to open - short) 52.5 strike calls @ $2.82 per contract X 20 contracts = $5640 (minus $1080 premium has a total premium of $4560)

At this point we have an option position with 20 contracts of 50 strike calls long and 20 contracts of 52.5 strike calls short to create the bullish vertical call spread.

[https://imgur.com/a/N6qvn1w](https://imgur.com/a/N6qvn1w) 

The total cost for this vertical spread is $4560 - $3800 = $760.

Total cost = $760  
Max Loss = $760  
Max Profit = $4240

However, our break even point is now at $50.40 on the underlying INTC shares. Our risk to reward is now extremely favorable and the price can go down a little and we still break even!

**Conclusion:**

While the “shiny object” of unlimited profit using long call options is enticing, the time decay (theta) factor moves the break even price at expiration further up requiring that options traders are correct about the magnitude of the move as well as the time that the move takes place.

I wussed out on buying the crash on the way down.  Told myself I wouldn't make the same mistake on the way up.

Here's one major thing I understand from all this.  If you're going to buy and hold bull ETFs, you have to wait for a crash and buy on a confirmed recovery. You just have to.  If you buy now, you're going to have to day trade them.  

Between TQQQ, TECL, QLD, SOXL, and RYVYX I have been making a KILLING in both unrealized and realized gains.  Every time one would dip, I'd put more in.  Is it easy watching one fund go up 6% one day and then down 4% the next?  No, never is.  Is it smart to leave a lot of money in these funds over the course of a very long time?  Probably not.  But if we could go through crashes like what happened end of 2018 and beginning of 2020 that had V shaped recoveries without these funds getting dismantled, the only thing I could see stopping them would be another 2008-2009 crash, which I'm actually waiting for because all of what's going on right now just reminds me of The Big Short so much.  

This week I dropped about half my RYVYX in my self-managed 401k because the expense ratio is just ridiculous and QLD actually beats it over he course of the last ten years.  Also this week, I dropped about half my TQQQ and TECL in my self-managed IRA.  So I could load up on some high dividend monthly stocks. I've been in these for 5 months now.  That's a lifetime when compared to how long they say you should hold these.

Very (very!) new to trading at the moment, only investing about $100 yet, as I learn the ropes. My question might be super silly, but I am really confused. 

I know Abbott prices already went up quite a bit in the last month or so, but as far as I can tell, the market didn't really react to the news about their fast and cheap tests as much. With COVID vaccines, the promising companies keep rising and have risen even a few hundred percent when they announced they are in later stages of development. The news came out that Abbott's fast test was FDA approved, and millions of it were ordered already, and it will likely even make it to countries around the world, yet the price barely moved up, before falling again.

&lt;p&gt;Very (very!) new to trading at the moment, only investing about $100 yet, as I learn the ropes. My question might be super silly, but I am really confused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know Abbott prices already went up quite a bit in the last month or so, but as far as I can tell, the market didn&amp;#39;t really react to the news about their fast and cheap tests as much. With COVID vaccines, the promising companies keep rising and have risen even a few hundred percent when they announced they are in later stages of development. The news came out that Abbott&amp;#39;s fast test was FDA approved, and millions of it were ordered already, and it will likely even make it to countries around the world, yet the price barely moved up, before falling again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could someone tell me what I am missing? I would kinda expect it to rise big right now (I literally only have $15 in it, so no real loss on my part, just trying to learn)&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hello Fellow Redditor Traders, 

I realized that trading a particular system is not about the system itself but on the approach of the user, an infinite amount of strategies exist out there and if a user is littered with a negative, inpatient, impulsive, loss averse, etc mindset than not even the ""top"" performing strategies would be of use. Thus, to me it seems that I get into this negative mindset from time to time, going into frequent draw-downs and consistent losses (low success rate) but fortunately with adequate risk management (to an extent) which kept my capital alive for this past year of actively trading the Forex market (-15% thus far).
 
I am detail oriented and have a very detailed journal of every trade I take/ took (&gt;500 trades mainly Forex) with statistical calculations on the different strategies that I have formulated, implemented, and back-tested manually (and have mostly failed due to user error in live markets). I can help with providing reflection on the trade setups technically and fundamentally, formulating a trading plan from scratch, formulating strategies, establishing adequate risk management and provide self-reflection as I fully know how it could be when stuck in a negative cycle. 

I need someone to reciprocate accountability with (Currently at GMT +4 but wont mind the time difference in effort to make this work), I have a trend continuation based strategy that can work if I have the right mindset towards it, thus I would like to find someone to hold me accountable for the trades I enter during the week (end of week review) and also share ideas with back and forth on the different setups that are provided during the week.

&lt;p&gt;For example, Nav Singh Sarao, the infamous day trader who aparently contributed to the flash crash in 2010, was punished because he made bots that would spoof the market. These bots would make it look like he would put in large orders, which would cause HFT algorithms to react, and then cancel the orders and trade against the reaction. You could argue he understood how these HFT algos worked and he exploited the inefficiencies. Yet, HFT firms complained to regulators that it wasn&amp;#39;t fair but they are practically doing the same thing. They&amp;#39;re making billions at the expense of every other market participant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I&amp;#39;m all for utilizing technology to make markets more efficient. But who draws the line? Why are some people punished for taking advantage of inefficiencies whereas others are rewarded? I just feel like every market participant should benefit the market.&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"I am following the markets for some time and I noticed a rapid growth in Tesla stock price that happened recently (and is still going on) and which I would like if someone can help me understand.

During the most of the last year the price was somewhere at $250, give or take. Then in the last quarter it started to grow steadily and was priced at around $400 by the end of the year, even though there weren't much of a change within the company itself. Then in January 2020. the price started to grow to around $600-$700, spiking in February at $950.

Then it looks like the stock turned into bearish, with the price steadily dropping back to about $400 in the next month or so, after when it started gaining again. At first, it rose to about $800 and then to $900 in the next 2-months period.

Then, about two months ago, something happened and the price started rapidly going up, day after day, gaining maybe roughly $150 per week.

After a week, I doubled my money and wanted to withdraw but Simon told me to cancel it because we need money in the account. So I cancelled it and continued trading (It was dumb of me). It was a BA stock I was in. After a week, the stocks started falling, I wanted to close everything but Simon told me to hold it in because it will bounce back up (he knew full well that I'm unable to sustain it).

,Trading,"Hi everyone, I just opened my Roth IRA and am watching all the learning videos and reading up on investing as much as I can, so I haven't started trading yet. I've also had my 401K for about 13 years but leave it alone for the most part. I'm aiming to be more active in my investments as I educate myself.

My problem is that I'm asleep during trading hours. I'm thinking of keeping my retirement accounts as index/mutual funds and opening a separate investment account that I can put a little money in and actively trade a few stocks here and there when I'm awake. The earliest I can be awake to trade is about 3 p.m. Eastern Time, which leaves me about an hour to trade. I can do this a few times a week without losing quality sleep.

One advice I got from another sub is that I should make an exact plan on what to buy and sell before going to bed, then trade when I wake up. I've also been told ETFs would be good since they're traded at the end of the day, and not that often. I was also advised to avoid trading after-hours as it's risky, and that I can't buy international stocks that easily.

We go through a ton of his recent trades discussing where he bought/sold and why including CELH PRTS ZM FUTU APPS.

,Trading,"Hi everyone

So I have done some trading, on and off now for maybe 2 years, and never really got anywhere with it. I guess you can say i did it for fun and never really had the time to fully commit to it. Recently I just finished ""How to day trade for a living"" and throught i would start to take it more seriously.

For now I'm concentrating on a simple MACD and EMA200 crossover stratgy that I watched on the YT channel Trading Rush, which showed a win rate of roughly 60%.  I decided to backtest this strategy myself on TradingView and my result was similar with his results of roughly 60% after testing it over nearly 9 months worth of data(During the times of day that i would trade).

However,  when i went live to the markets this week(On a demo account) my winrate is coming out at just 19%! It literally felt like I lost every position!

Can you think of any other suggests as for why there is such a massive difference between my backtested strategy and my live market results? 

 I had two positions, where one hit my stop loss  before reversing and then continued in the predicted direction that i wanted it to go, and another where it went in the predicted direct but reversed just 10 points short of my take profit(unfortunately i was busy so missed this) it then went in the opposite direction and took out my stop loss, so i can justify these losses, but the rest of the time it just seemed like it kept going against me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've added my graphcs here.   
[https://imgur.com/a/MK3KjI2](https://imgur.com/a/MK3KjI2)

Although i stuck with my 1:2 ratio on every trade, I stupidly was changing the amount of money per trade depending on what i was trading... anywhere from ""$200:$400 to $100:$200"" so I know I need to work on a consistant 1% or 0.5% risk etc rather than changing the amount risked per trade. However i still dont see why this would result in such a drastic loss this week!

,Trading,"Hi guys,

This one's a bit of a weird question but I couldn't find anything from my own searches and wouldn't know where else to post this - I'm looking to organize a currency speculation / forex trading competition (if not, stock &amp; shares will do too) at my college and was looking for a platform that would allow you to create ranked trading groups and trade with virtual cash within that group.

There used to be a good one called Bullbearings, where you could set up a virtual trading group and see individual user's net gain/loss within that group, but that sadly closed down a few years ago - something similar to that platform would definitely be what I'm looking for!

,Trading,"I'm sure these questions get asked constantly, but guys like Tim Grittani and Dux both seem to be pretty mathematically/pattern based traders (as a math guy myself, this naturally attracts me). 

Tim Grittani in particular seems to specifically say what patterns he looks to look for an actively trades. Why would he do this? From my understanding (which is probably flawed), in order to make money on the market he needs an edge. If for example, everyone understands the exit point that he is seeing, and also gets out of a stock, wouldn't that drastically hurt his value as well?

,Trading,"I made a similar post in /r/investing, but it's probably more relevant here. If you recommend a platform and I make the switch to it, I'll Paypal/Venmo you $100 (or make a $100 donation to a reputable US-based charity of your choosing if you prefer not to send your email...bitcoin would probably work too if that's easy enough for me to set up).  Scout's honor on whether I make the switch. (It may take a couple weeks for me to make a decision and potentially switch.)

I'm a part-time fundamental trader and primarily trade equities and options. I use e\*Trade which is what I've always used because I fell into trading after being purely a long-term investor. There are a lot of limitations to e\*Trade, and it's high time that I see if I can find a platform that's better for my style of trading. I'm wondering if anyone could recommend another broker that you've been pleased with that has some features that would be helpful for me. Basically, I'm looking for the ability to organize and track my positions more easily within the platform itself.

I primarily do my research outside of market hours and place orders to open positions that have one day to several month time horizons, so I don't need fancy real-time dashboards for playing super short-term movements (though it would be nice to see an order book when placing orders).

Below are the features that I'd like to have. I doubt any platform has all of these, but if one has several (and favorable fees), it'd help me a lot:

* (Top Need) Allows for positions to be sorted into thematic folders and be able to see the current balance of each, and ideally the performance of each (but the balance is fine). 
   * It'd be great if it allows a % of every position within a thematic folder to be sold with one bulk action, but this may be a stretch. (I park a lot of idle cash in newly IPO'ed SPACs, and if I need the cash for a large more active position, I have to manually sell a portion of each.)
      * It'd also be great if it's possible to set a sequence of events i.e. Sell X at market and buy Y at market.
* Supports the input of custom note types for individual positions, as well as the convenient display of these notes  (i.e. ""Investment Thesis"", ""Anticipated Holding Period"", ""Number of Attached Warrants"", etc) in columns alongside the statistics for the position. e\*Trade allows notes, but it's not very visible.
* Allows the set-up of some sort of warning message when going to sell a specific position (i.e. You asked me to remind you before selling: ""Do not sell this unless it looks like Joe Biden is going to lose the election. Are you sure he's going to lose?"")
* Allows for both automated and custom reminders to be configured for individual positions (i.e. toggle on/off reminders for upcoming earnings call(s), product announcements, etc as well as custom reminders like ""In 12 months, remind me to to assess whether Walmart+ is gaining traction. If not, sell half of this position.""
* Makes it easy to set both a stop-loss order and a limit sell order (so the position is sold if it crosses a lower / upper limit). There are positions that I'd only like to hold to a certain point. Currently, if I have a stop-loss order set for risk management as I do on several positions, I cannot also set a limit sell order to take profit at a certain level.
* Allows for open orders to be programmed to cancel if certain criteria are met (i.e. I have a 60-day buy order in for call options on a certain stock that is under contract to be acquired for cash. If the stock price falls below a certain threshold, it almost certainly signals that the buyer somehow backed out. I would like to be able to have that options buy order automatically cancel if the stock falls below $X, or else someone would sell me the options and get free money before I have a chance to manually cancel.)",t2_lmsju,False,,0,False,Help selecting a new platform that has better features,[],r/Trading,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_i6pd62,False,dark,0.79,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1597029912.0,text,6,,,text,self.Trading,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a similar post in &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;/r/investing&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s probably more relevant here.

There are a lot of limitations to e*Trade, and it&amp;#39;s high time that I see if I can find a platform that&amp;#39;s better for my style of trading. I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone could recommend another broker that you&amp;#39;ve been pleased with that has some features that would be helpful for me.

First, I plan to use two sets of Bollinger Bands, one with a 1sd and the other with a 2sd. If the price goes above the 1sd upper band I'llconsider it my signal for buy, placing take peofit directly above the 2sd upper band and my stop loss right below the 1sd lower band.

Now, I plan to use RSI to gauge the trend, using 50 as a point of reference, only entering the trade with the Bollinger Band strategy mentioned above when it goes above 50.

Maybe I can add a MACD to see if there is going to be a soon to happen convergence and have  a more solid grasp of how soon the trend will be possibly  reversing or if it'll still go on.

but I am quite confused, so here is my question

I have deposit to my etoro acc about $4000 I have made some trades so far the majority that are closed position are loses.

but my open positions are in profit. so I virtually have $6000

I have not cashed out any money so far.

,Trading,"When I first started trading, I used to add all indicators on my chart. MACD, RSI, super trend, ATR, ichimoku cloud, Bollinger Bands, everything!

My chart was pretty messy. I understood nothing and my analysis was pretty much just a gamble.

Nothing worked.

Then I learned price action trading. And things started to change. It seemed difficult and unreliable at first.

There's a saying in my country. ""Bhav Bhagwan Che"" it means ""Price Is GOD"".

That holds true in the market.

Amos Every indicator you see is based on price. RSI uses open/close price and so does moving average. MACD uses price.

Price is what matters the most.

Everything depends on the price, and then the indicators send a signal.

Price Action trading is trading based on Candlestick patterns and support and resistance. You don't use any indicators (SMA sometimes), use plot trend lines and support and resistance zones, maybe Fibs or Pivot points.

It is not 100% successful, but the win rate is quite high if you know how to analyse it correctly.

,Trading,"Hey guys,

I'm new to this to please excuse the noob question 

I've been offered a chance through a good friend to get involved with a trader who's making my mate money trading for him on his account, CFDs

So far he's smashing it for them and my question is this.

What's am I missing? It seems too good to be true and you know what they say about that 

There's a small monthly fee then over a certain amount he gets 30% of the profits 

My first concern was if he miss managed the money I could get into debt but from talking the the platform I'm trading on they said that could never happen and if it did they'd write it off if I wanted to stop trading with them.

So as far as I can see all I'm risking is my deposit plus whatever profit is made,  I could never get into debt which was my only major concern 

Is there anything else I should be worried about that could go wrong apart from him wiping my account out?

Could there be a bigger play here from him I'm missing or is this just a trader trying to get rich faster via other people's accounts with no risk to himself?

As part of my process, I'm trying to be clever and pay off my wedding expenses before starting to put hard onto investing funds, so I only give myself at best £20-30 a month to play with as junk food or games/whatever money, but instead of waiting and ONLY studying trading for the next year or so, I would really like a bit of experience and context trying some trading with a little 'throwaway cash'. 

Some might suggest the trading platform trials with a pretend 50K to play with, but it's far less realistic for me to ever achieve having 5K before even starting,  is this an option anywhere?

,Trading,"Hello guys! I have been trading in the Financial markets for about 4 years now. Last year I got an opportunity to trade in the electricity markets of USA (**ERCOT** to be specific). I didn't know such markets even existed until then. 

Over the past year and a half, I realized these markets are highly seasonal and **predictable accuracy** is higher compared to any other financial markets (as there's a lot of political influence on a daily basis in most other financial assets), the underlying fact being that the behavior of people changes over years (sometimes decades) which in actual influences the demand and of course supply is limited to their maximum outputs from traditional methods and renewable sources like Wind and Nuclear are a pain in the arse to the producers of electricity as they can't be controlled/managed instantaneously to change the output of electricity based on demand (All of this makes sense because electricity can't be stored economically and the best bet right now is to try and match the demand and supply simultaneously). So, electricity traders could even take advantage of negative prices. 

Anyways, my point is that I realized the US and European electricity markets are quite different in their structure. While USA promotes good spread between the prices in the Day Ahead(yes, buyers and sellers go for an auction a day ahead but there are also real-time markets to manage the unexpected changes in demand and supply) and hence the Real-Time markets, Europe tries to keep it to a minimal. Recently, I came across **NordPool** where we could trade the majority electricity markets in the Europe. I would like to know if some of you are in this line of profession or business and how feasible is it to trade the European electricity markets given that their motive is to keep the spread between their Day-Ahead and Real-Time markets as less as possible. If I were to build a web-based analytics tool(to use for myself and sell it too eventually) to trade the products offered by NordPool would it be a profitable deal as I can't stick to ERCOT since I'm moving to the Europe soon.

I'm not sure if all of you here have come across both methods, or whether you have tried them out both yourself, but essentially, I'm having a dilemma with 2 very different methods of approach and outcomes to trading the markets.

1\. How the institutions do it:
* Systematic, using algorithms and a very methodical approach.
* Longer term, usually a matter of days or weeks or months.
* Includes Hedging and various other methods to preserve profits and reduce risk.
* Good profits usually means 20-30% gains per annum.

2\. How retail traders do it:
* Discretionary, usually price action based, reactive trading.
* Shorter term, typically Day Trading. No overnight positions (there are always longer term traders, but I'm talking most)
* Good profits can range from 20%-1000% per annum.

So. I'm pretty sure the professional/institutional side of the story is real. Because it makes much more sense and the profits are also within realistic values. However, there are all these retail traders out there boasting and posting doubling their capital within a month or so. Yes, I'm sure some are fake, but I don't think ALL of them are phonies?

,Trading,"Hi,

First off sorry if this turns out to be an extremely stupid question, but I've just got this idea, and I wanted to share it and see if it makes any sense and if it does, what's it called in the industry so I could research it more. It's essentially about exchanging currencies. I am a software developer, but I like to think about stuff sometimes and this is the latest thing I've come up with:

So, say you have an exchange market:

* with rates for 3 currencies
* there is a buy rate and a sell rate for each currency pair
* the buy/sell rates between pairs is *relative to each-other*  (this means you may buy currency A cheaper if you're using currency B than currency C, hope this makes sense)

So with the above 3 points, I'll give the following trading example (using real exchange rates from a national bank). You have CAD as your base currency . The target is to get 100 USD.

* Simplest exchange: buy 100 USD for 135.80 CAD
* But 100 USD may also be bought with 87.61 EUR.
* But  for 87.61 EUR you have to pay only 135.79 CAD.
* Therefore it's cheaper for you to change your CAD -&gt; EUR -&gt; USD.  And Bonus, at the end of the day you may sell your $100 for CAD and end up with your profit of 0.1 CAD (sure the sell rate may be smaller than the buy rate, in reality, but you may still end-up with anything between 0 and 0.1).

Does this make any sense ? Am I over-simplifying it, what else am I missing ?

What would this be called in real-life-trading ?

Do the exchange markets actively protect themselves against this ? (I would assume so - if the idea makes sense in the first place)

If this makes any sense at all, things can get interesting then you add more than 3 currencies

iam currently trading on plus500 commodties, currencies, stocks, everything. i dont pay anything for a trade and i get all the data for all 2000 isntruments included.

why would i ever use ninja trader?\_?

iam sure iam missing something, but what?

sure i pay overnight fees etc, but for 100 trades (50 opens and 50 close) i pay at max 100€ (overnight funding and adjustments). where in NT for example i pay at least 2 dollar per trade on every trade PLUS exchange &amp; NFA, plus order routing, plus commisions.

are these platforms really that much more expensive to use or am i caluclating everything wrong?

,Trading," Hey everyone. Had a trade sent over in FSLY that had quite a bit going on. It started on 6 July w/ a (4) short 65/105 strangles. After it started moving, he began adjusting the strangle (took the puts down, rolled the calls) then added more calls and eventually put on a 90 straddle as well. 

A few notes.

* Let the trade work. Intervention should be a last line. We should afford the trade every opportunity to work.
* Be focused in your repair strategy. Having defined criteria and adjustments will make the trade easier to manage.
* Take advantage of opportunity. He saw great premium in a straddle and went for it - despite the rest of the position not doing well. 
* When adding different legs and strategies, I like to track separately then add the total PnLs together - makes following the position quite a bit easier.

&lt;li&gt;Regarding getting started, what would you want more than anything else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much in advance - look forward to reading about your answers!&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hi all.

I've been fascinated by the financial market for some time now. But I have always been wondering **why are there patterns in stocks?**

Is this due to the fact that there is an abundance of day traders (or companies) that spend their time analysing the market and playing on these patterns? This would mean if everyone sees a pattern that would be bullish that everyone would buy a stock so it does indeed go up. Does this mean that it is a psychological game? The patterns work because everyone thinks they work that way?

Or is it just the nature of stocks, and there is nothing to do about it. I invest plentiful in stocks for the long-term (10+ years), so I don't pay attention to patterns. But do I indirectly, unknowingly, add to the effect of the pattern? Or are people like me that make a bearish pattern eventually bullish because I am not paying attention to the patterns? Connected to this question is then: do patterns only work if there is a certain ratio of short term / long term traders?

I want to understand more about this subject; not just by looking up patterns and blindly agreeing it is bullish or bearish; but by understanding the fundamentals of patterns, why do they appear, who makes them appear, and whether it's all just psychological warfare.

As a bonus question, does it make a difference to look at patterns in months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds? Does this just depend on how many active traders are trading in that time period? e.g. if no one actively trades in hours, then it doesn't make sense to do it (this couples back to the fact that active traders agree on patterns, so psychological effect).

Expectancy tells us how a strategy will perform if we apply the same approach (average R-Multiple). R-Multiples let us see our average risk adjusted return. These tools work together to allow traders to analyze strategies and make adjustments. If you're only thinking about POP, you're missing an even more important part of the conversation.

,Trading,"Spent a month studying up lurking reddit, YouTube, investopedia.  Paper traded during the study time, resetting initial balance each time I explored a new strategy till it was consistently winning...day trades or 2-5 day windows, using Webull.  Afraid of options and margin (for now, too green).

Put $2500 in, up 8.93% 1 1/2 weeks in...so far so good.

Current strategy is using IC, MACD, StochRSI indicators, scanning for stocks with high volatility and higher than normal volume between 1m and 1d windows, and pulling the trigger on something pre-market that meets the following conditions: 

All three indicators at the beginning of a positive trend crossover for open

A positive news cycle during closing the night before or early early morning for the company

Dow futures up at least 100

As soon as market opens I watch it like a hawk and try to sell the peak of the first bump, anywhere from 5-45min in watching both indicators and other stocks in same industry as a cue for trend direction...sell point is anywhere from 3-8% unless bad news taints the market as a whole, then I pull the chute immediately.

Here's what's next...I finally received a settlement check for $83k from a bicycle accident 2yrs ago and I'm depositing it in my webull account tomorrow so I'm ready for a possible play in VXX as I think I have strong data to support a massive market dive 2-3 weeks from now.

What (if anything) am I doing right, what should I absolutely absorb knowledge on before proceeding further, what tools/insight should I add/replace in current setup to enhance my current strategy?  

Not looking to YOLO (apart from VXX play, very low downside), however would be interested in other strategies that can net consistent 2-5% gains per trade.  I figure if I can maintain 4-5 trades/day I should be able to nest up half into a few stable growth picks with good dividends, 40% back into current strategy, 10% into options/swing trades until I get it down.

Feel free to tear this apart...I'd like to think I'm not an idiot, but usually anyone that isn't willing to admit that they can be ends up proving themselves wrong fast.  Mild autism and OCD...might help me see patterns, might cause analysis paralysis, might dive in 100% confident in theory only to have missed something obvious to everyone else, would like to avoid the last one.

Afraid of options and margin (for now, too green).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put $2500 in, up 8.93% 1 1/2 weeks in...so far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current strategy is using IC, MACD, StochRSI indicators, scanning for stocks with high volatility and higher than normal volume between 1m and 1d windows, and pulling the trigger on something pre-market that meets the following conditions: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three indicators at the beginning of a positive trend crossover for open&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive news cycle during closing the night before or early early morning for the company&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hi, I started trading online on the libertex platform. I’m currently studying and training on a demo account because I don’t think I have enough experience and shouldn’t get into it for the reason that at first it seems like quick and easy earnings, but it’s not like that and I’m aware of that. I devoted myself more to cryptocurrencies.

Hi, i saw this IQ Option site, and would like to give it a try, but i heard stories about how people cant withdraw or chart magically changes itself when you start trading with real money, that IQ Options is manipulating chart so you lose.

i plan to invest only 40 $, no more and no less.

should i proceed? if i make some money, i plan to quickly withdraw, so i can feel it is real thing.

i heard a lot that this binary trading is risky, but i saw somewhere how to earn ever if you lose once. this is how they described:

i deposit 40 $ on account, and i start trading only with 1$, because it supports that low.

and if i lose 1 $ , next time, i multiply it with 2.5 so i could cover my first try and this secod try, so i can earn from both. so if i lose 1$ by putting on BUY, i invest 2.5$ and choose SELL, and if i lose again, i invest 6.25$ and choose BUY, and if i lose again i invest 15.62$ and choose SELL, and if i loose again i invest 39.06$ and choose BUY.

those who explained this method say, that you will always win on this, it maybe dont have to be first try, but definitely you will not go more than 4 tries, you will always win this way and get money.

so basically strategy is to chose opposite from what i choosed and to multiply by 2.5, so i can cover previous, and earn from all those.

is IQ Options a scam, do they allow you to withdraw money without any problems, because i read that thay cant withdraw more money than how much you gave deposit if you payed with visa card, you need to use like skrill or similar ebanking in order to get money on visa card.

and what other would you reccomend, because i needwithdraw to work every time.",t2_3ilbxsr1,False,,0,False,"IQ Options, real trader?",[],r/Trading,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_hl9p4c,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1593921851.0,text,6,,,text,self.Trading,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, i saw this IQ Option site, and would like to give it a try, but i heard stories about how people cant withdraw or chart magically changes itself when you start trading with real money, that IQ Options is manipulating chart so you lose.&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hi all,

I want to begin investing in stocks but not doing so until I have done proper research.

One of the main research points has been wether to go with CFD or actual stocks, when researching this I read this 

&gt; “If the cost of the stock goes up, the broker, which offers these contracts, gives you the profit, and if the price goes down, you need to cover the losses.”

Does this mean I have to pay extra on top of what I already paid for the CFD or does this just mean I’ve lost however much the price has dropped?

What are the real benefits of CFD also, I’ve read conflicting statements where it says the risk is too high for new traders and others say it is good for new traders due to the possibility of short term investments. 

I feel I “know” when to invest and keep up to date with all business news etc. so feel from that aspect I am going in the right direction.

I’ve opened a Trading212 account and been playing around with the practise account for a bit and really enjoy it.

I am a pretty experienced trader but people tend to not take me seriously because I’m a woman. Here is one example that has made me feel this way, do any of you have experiences like this?

I have a male friend who got a new trading platform picked up by investors (with a team) even though I have absolutely never heard of him trading before 
We have grown apart since and he came back to talk to me today and tried to make me feel inferior by using buzz words and making my strategy seem invalid. He also clearly stated his return to try and seem more impressive, I didn’t ask.

I have had a foot in the investing game before he has, I research the market, I was hired by 3 people to help manage their investments/advise finances, and I just absolutely have more experience with it.

To make matters worse, my career is SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT so I am always building apps, programs, webapps, etc. and he is trying to sound as if he understands more about those things when he is (and has always been) in the medical field. He has someone else developing this trading platform and I know for a fact from the start that he had no intentions of working with the software.

I have no issue with people who are less experienced and I love helping people with things related to trading and money. That is why I am trusted to manage the assets of 3 people. I just feel that there is no other reason for people to treat me this way when it is not a competition

Been investing passively for some years now and for the last few months (because of remote work) have been actively putting time watching the market and my portfolio.

One of my long time longs Match Group $MTCH as some interesting stuff happening to it. One of which is the 75% of Float Shorted.

My only experience with this kind of numbers is BBBY which had ~35% of float shorted in March 2019. 
In 26/03/2019 it jumped ~22% because of the squeeze without a specific catalyst. I never saw 75% of float shorted tho, and wanted to get knowledge from some of you guys who were fortunate or not to experience stuff like this.

&lt;p&gt;My only experience with this kind of numbers is BBBY which had ~35% of float shorted in March 2019. 
In 26/03/2019 it jumped ~22% because of the squeeze without a specific catalyst. I never saw 75% of float shorted tho, and wanted to get knowledge from some of you guys who were fortunate or not to experience stuff like this.&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hello Trading Community!

I was hoping someone could please give me some clarity on this question:

When you sell a stock, I know we are selling to a market maker that provides liquidity. 

My current understanding is that we are not selling directly to another investor but to an institution or market maker on the exchange that is holding our stock. Essentially, every sell and every buy, they are ticking upwards or downwards on the bid / ask spread. 

What I am curious is, is that Tim Sykes has said to not put a physical stop loss, but a mental / manual one, so the market makers don't stop you out. How exactly does that even play out? If all of these transactions are moving the spread up and down, they are profiting every time the price reverses. Why would holding out longer help their profit line?

The only I see this being true is that a third party (institutional, hedge fund, or another market maker) comes into the party and decides to take a position to short, triggering the majority of the stops that retails are trading on, and then unloading a buy position after--- but wouldn't they have to cover as well?

Understand in any market you are mainly competing with hedge funds or other institutional investors that have dozens of PhD's that definitely understand the market better than you. All these apparently ""successful"" traders on YouTube are only making money from the material they sell rather than from actual trading performance. The actual successful day traders mainly work at proprietary funds that would never disclose anything related to their investment strategy.

Even if they charged thousands of dollars they could make a lot more money trading on it that you would from selling courses. Also the more people that trade on that idea the lower the opportunity is. Any edge you give to others will make it dry up faster.

I really think the beauty of trading is that you can never fully understand anything. There's always more you can do to try to get an edge but no one really knows what's going on. If you want to trade, then join an established trading firm. If you can't get in, be cautious as there's a lot of firms out there that want to sell the experience of being a trader at your expense.

Has anyone tried investing or backtesting a portfolio using their list of high alpha names for over a year? Their historical list only goes back to March.

I took their list from March and plugged it in Finviz and I see a nice equity curve returning +200% over the SPY. It has about a 50% drawdown due to the nature of the holdings during the COVID downturn but can be hedged to smooth the drawdown to 25%.

Results are amazing just wondering why I can't seem to find much articles or research about using weighted alpha in a portfolio. Now I understand this is highly weighted towards recent performance, but I think this approach is worth looking into.

,Trading,"Hello,

I am trying to decide and work out a strategy based on dynamic hedging.

So for example, I have  strategy which can possibly outperform SPY by 2 times, but in a bull market.

I want to start hedging when there is turbulence in market possibly with liquidating some portfolio and getting Long on some bonds (so not exactly hedging but lower returns)

I want to know what criteria can I use to decide if the market should be hedged like I can use VIX, I can use six month ROE for the stocks and stop if negative or something else?

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to decide and work out a strategy based on dynamic hedging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example, I have  strategy which can possibly outperform SPY by 2 times, but in a bull market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start hedging when there is turbulence in market possibly with liquidating some portfolio and getting Long on some bonds (so not exactly hedging but lower returns)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know what criteria can I use to decide if the market should be hedged like I can use VIX, I can use six month ROE for the stocks and stop if negative or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any pointers which can help me decide when to stop buying and start hedging?&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Over the last two weeks I’ve interacted with over 400 investors directly. It was a mix of educational chats, creating a videos, and discussing strategy/trades. Something I’ve noticed is that many traders don’t seem to understand what they’re trading for, what success looks like, and it’s no surprise that folks are having a hard time creating a plan to get there. 

Investing is similar to any other life goal. We need to understand what success looks like (extremely individualized) then work our way back. How do we measure it? What’s the timeline? Is it challenging yet achievable? What’s the plan to make it happen?

If you haven’t taken the time to truly define what you want to achieve with your investing career, you’ll likely wander aimlessly drifting between profitability. I know we joke about it but “doubling my account”,  “living off dividends”, “beating the market”, “being rich”, or “buying a car I’ve always wanted” are all superficial and add little context for you to model your trading plan after. 

If you’re unsure how to develop a goal, reach out to the community. That’s what we’re here for. To support one another’s development.

,Trading,"After Nikola went public earlier this month through a reverse merger with VectorIQ, the stock has skyrocketed, and Nikola is now worth $23.78 billion. With Nikola trading only $1 billion away from the current value of Ford and not expecting revenue until at least late 2021, I feel everyone can agree this company is overvalued.

One reason the stock has exploded in value is due to the potential ""$10 billion in sales"" coming from ""14,000 reservations."" Nikola is not expecting the production of its trucks to begin until at least late 2021. This delay would be followed by full production capability being met sometime in the second half of 2022. Currently, there are only 39 hydrogen filling stations in the U.S. (35 in California). This number is tiny in comparison to the approximately 25,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. as of March 2020. It would be a considerable feat if Nikola were able to finish developing their truck, construct a manufacturing facility, and construct the hydrogen infrastructure around the country necessary for a fleet of hydrogen vehicles to operate all in just two years.

Hydrogen vehicles are also inherently less efficient than electric vehicles. A hydrogen vehicle requires that 1) electricity be used to produce and compress hydrogen (Nikola claims all its hydrogen stations will use this method with renewable energy), and 2) that stored hydrogen be used in a hydrogen vehicle to create electricity. So basically, electricity is used to make hydrogen, and that hydrogen is then used to produce electricity again. Fully electric cars do not have to convert electricity and are therefore more efficient. Currently, converting water to hydrogen is approximately 75% efficient and requires a massive amount of electricity. Nikola claims that they will use renewable energy to produce all the hydrogen at its stations, which will undoubtedly increase costs further.

The increased costs associated with hydrogen are why both Honda and Toyota have virtually abandoned their fuel cell vehicle development. In fact, Honda's fuel cell-powered Clarity had such low sales that Honda developed it to be a fully electric vehicle that runs on batteries.

Hydrogen is not the way to a more renewable future and is almost always going to be a more expensive and less efficient option when compared to electricity. While I am not arguing that Tesla specifically will be the winner, I do think it will be an electric semi-truck from some manufacturer. Volkswagen, Mercedes, Porsche, and many other vehicle manufacturers are investing heavily in electric vehicles because they know it is the best route to take.

Hydrogen vehicles are not the future.

These two companies have been under investigation since 2012 and while Tyson has seen no such charges. On June 10th, Tyson showed its solidarity against price-fixing by announcing that it will be cooperating with the Justice Department to investigate price-fixing within the industry further. Tyson is the first meat producer to announce this cooperation and thus will avoid criminal prosecution. Tyson has been subpoenaed numerous times in the past, with nothing coming out of these investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyson remains a substantial investment opportunity in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

c)  Have a  wide range of instruments available (e.g. allowing for margins  on SL  order and/or dealing in CFDs, providing options, futures and  having  those available for stocks, bonds, ETFs, currencies and  commodities  traded on all major exchanges)

* IB   (I feel like you'd need 2+ years of training to use their interface, I   tried to upload some documents required to trade a certain type of   derivative and after 1+ hour of 60 second loading screens and loops I   gave up on them)... potentially still the best option, since commissions   are decent and they are big enough to \*hopefully\* have a working   system, but I'd rather use a more modern platform
* XTB (commissions are crazy high, very limited selection of instruments and symbols)

More than 45m people in the US have filed for unemployment benefits

more than 45m people in the US have filed for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus outbreak has started which is about 30% of the workforce. The pandemic has led to an alarming surge in the losses of people jobs soaring the unemployment level to a post-World War II record high.

The US unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent in May 2020 from 14.7% in April which was the largest in records back to 1939 and below market expectations of 19.8 percent, as the economy gradually reopened. The number of unemployed persons fell by 2.1 million to 21.0 million as those who were on temporary layoff decreased by 2.7 million to 15.3 million. Among those not on temporary layoff, the number of permanent job losers increased by 295,000 to 2.3 million. The number of employed rose by 3.8 million to 137.2 million and the labor force participation rate increased to 60.8 percent, after hitting the lowest since January 1973 the month before. Since February, the unemployment rate was up by 9.8 percentage points and the number of unemployed persons increased by 15.2 million.

INTERNATIONAL TOURISM RECEIPTS COULD PLUNGE BY US$ 1 TRILLION

Tourism makes up some 10% of global GDP. It is estimated it provides 1 in 10 jobs. The potential impact of the pandemic on international tourism could be devastating due to which 100 to 120 million people who are directly involved in tourism could lose their jobs. **850 million to 1.1 billion** fewer international tourist arrivals are also expected next year due to which the tourism industry could suffer a loss of up to **US$ 1.2 trillion.**

📷

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the tourism industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as a slump in demand among travelers. The tourism industry has been massively affected by the spread of coronavirus, as many countries have introduced travel restrictions in an attempt to contain its spread\[1\]. The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 20–30% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$30–50 billion.\[2\] In many of the world’s cities, planned travel went down by 80–90%.\[3\] Many tourist attractions around the world, such as museums, amusement parks, and sports venues, are closed.

Retail sales among the hardest hit

Retail sales in the US sank 16.4 percent from a month earlier in April of 2020, worse than forecasts of a 12 percent drop. It is the sharpest decrease in retail sales ever due to the coronavirus pandemic which forced Americans to stay at home and many businesses to close. Biggest declines were seen in sales of clothing and accessories (-78.8 percent), electronics and appliances (-60.6 percent), and furniture (-58.7 percent). Sales at gasoline stations decreased 28.8 percent after oil prices turned negative for the first time ever in April. Other decreases were also seen in food and beverage stores (-13.1 percent) and food services and drinking places (-29.5 percent). Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales tumbled 15.3 percent. Year-on-year, retail sales went down 21.6 percent, also a record drop.

Business confidence reaches the lowest level since April of 2009

The ISM Manufacturing PMI for the US increased to 43.1 in May of 2020 from 41.5 in April which was the lowest reading since April of 2009. However, figures came below market forecasts of 43.6 and pointed to a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector. “The coronavirus pandemic impacted all manufacturing sectors for the third straight month. May appears to be a transition month, as many panelists and their suppliers returned to work late in the month. However, demand remains uncertain, likely impacting inventories, customer inventories, employment, imports, and a backlog of orders. Among the six biggest industry sectors, Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products remains the only industry in expansion. Transportation Equipment; Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; and Fabricated Metal Products continue to contract at strong levels,” says Fiore, Chair of the ISM.

Coronavirus stimulus just pushed Fed’s balance sheet past $6 trillion for the first time ever

The Fed has already injected more than $3 trillion into the economy since the pandemic has started in order to save the economy from complete collapse. Central Bank Balance Sheet in the United States increased to 7113208 USD Million on June 10 from 7101184 USD Million in the previous week. Wall Street now anticipates the balance sheet could hit $10 trillion this year as the Fed affirms its whatever-it-takes commitment to softening the coronavirus blow. Critics have worried about the possibility of inflation resulting from all that extra cash in the system, though it hasn’t been a problem since the asset purchases started in late 2008.

why the stock market is going up?

Although we have already entered the recession still we have witnessed an amazing rebound in the global equity market.S&amp;P 500 the index has rebounded from 2200 level and currently trading at 3036 levels but how this could happen that when everything is so awful the equity market is climbing? Here we need to keep in mind that markets are forward-looking and don’t work in present instead collective expectations about future events are integrated into the current level. Although march low was a great speculative buy one needs to keep in mind that the rally has been mostly dependent on the tech companies which has benefited a lot during the lockdown.FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google)). Currently, they constitute roughly 20% of the S&amp;P 500. we believe what we have seen was a classic bear market rally and the real decline hasn’t even started yet.

&lt;p&gt;The ISM Manufacturing PMI for the US increased to 43.1 in May of 2020 from 41.5 in April which was the lowest reading since April of 2009. However, figures came below market forecasts of 43.6 and pointed to a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector. “The coronavirus pandemic impacted all manufacturing sectors for the third straight month. May appears to be a transition month, as many panelists and their suppliers returned to work late in the month. However, demand remains uncertain, likely impacting inventories, customer inventories, employment, imports, and a backlog of orders. Among the six biggest industry sectors, Food, Beverage &amp;amp; Tobacco Products remains the only industry in expansion. Transportation Equipment; Petroleum &amp;amp; Coal Products; and Fabricated Metal Products continue to contract at strong levels,” says Fiore, Chair of the ISM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus stimulus just pushed Fed’s balance sheet past $6 trillion for the first time ever&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed has already injected more than $3 trillion into the economy since the pandemic has started in order to save the economy from complete collapse. Central Bank Balance Sheet in the United States increased to 7113208 USD Million on June 10 from 7101184 USD Million in the previous week. Wall Street now anticipates the balance sheet could hit $10 trillion this year as the Fed affirms its whatever-it-takes commitment to softening the coronavirus blow. Critics have worried about the possibility of inflation resulting from all that extra cash in the system, though it hasn’t been a problem since the asset purchases started in late 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why the stock market is going up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we have already entered the recession still we have witnessed an amazing rebound in the global equity market.S&amp;amp;P 500 the index has rebounded from 2200 level and currently trading at 3036 levels but how this could happen that when everything is so awful the equity market is climbing? Here we need to keep in mind that markets are forward-looking and don’t work in present instead collective expectations about future events are integrated into the current level. Although march low was a great speculative buy one needs to keep in mind that the rally has been mostly dependent on the tech companies which has benefited a lot during the lockdown.FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google)). Currently, they constitute roughly 20% of the S&amp;amp;P 500. we believe what we have seen was a classic bear market rally and the real decline hasn’t even started yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications on Gold and Silver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold has acted as a safe haven in these turbulent times and the yellow metal prices are signaling the critical issue that exists in the global economy. Gold performs well during times of political, geopolitical, and financial uncertainty. So far, it is living up to its expectations as gold is up 15.3% this year while the S&amp;amp;P 500 is down 11.4%. Hedge funds are also adding significant portions of gold to there portfolios. We have also seen some large purchases by hedge funds in junior gold mining stocks. The gold market’s future looks bright as the global economy deals with unprecedented stimulus during a time of unprecedented uncertainty. We believe gold has a possibility to reach $2000 in upcoming months and the target for gold could be $1810.Silver has severely underperformed the gold since the rally in the precious metal sector has started but now it seems the white metal has started to follow gold however we are cautiously bullish on silver until it breaks above $18.20.After breaking out of $19 we could expect the substantial gain in the prices of silver. From a fundamental and technical perspective, we believe Gold, gold junior mining stocks, and selected crypto-assets should be preferred in the investment portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most powerful components of short premium trades is the ability to adjust - keeping track of what we're doing is extremely important to make sure we're not making small mistakes along the way. 

Keeping track of adjustments is extremely important for identifying credit required for a profitable roll, when we're profitable on the rolled position, and how much risk is on the table. In the purest form, we need to track ALL debits out and ALL credits in. There are different account methods based on how folks treat credit collected, so we can modify our tracking to align with how we use the capital. 

Key inputs: Ticker, Trade Date, Expiry, Stock $, Strike, Premium Received 

With these we can calculate a bunch of helpful metrics: Adjusted Net Credit, ROC, %AR, B/E, Downside Protection, etc. However, no need to over-complicate it. As long as you track your adjusted net credit.

\- Creating a goal is critical in our strategy development and validating whether we are truly outperforming the market or not.

\- The SP500 5 year CAGR is mid 11%, if yours isn't higher than that, it may be worth building a buy and hold portfolio while you refine your strategy paper trading.

\- It's important to expand our profit horizon from single trade or weekly basis. Understanding what we're working towards on a monthly and annual basis adds clarity to our approach.

\- I personally like to chart out monthly, annual, 5 year, and 10 year targets. The further targets tend to change but have found value in the actualization process.

We have been able to observe a high correlation between SPX500 and Bitcoin during the first COVID-19 crash. SPX500, Bitcoin, and all other markets have been down by a lot and from then, Bitcoin was very correlated to SPX500.

Us markets started going down again, Bitcoin followed (he was also showing weaknesses).
US markets are now closed for the weekend, as usual. This could let Bitcoin going up for the next two days, and then touching these white boxes.
Like I said, Bitcoin is not bearish yet, we have not broken any support, neither broke the neutral zone on the 4h RSI (that held from the dip at 3800$).

This is why I think we could go up checking these white boxes if the bulls are willing to support prices.
And by supporting prices, I mean, prices are a reflection of how many buyers compared to sellers there are.
If there are more buyers than sellers, the price will go up.
So if the volume follows, a good buying volume, we'll see these white boxes checked.

You can also notice that the two highlighted patterns look similar. Price action looks the same and the RSI also looks the same.
Of course, it will not be the same forever, but this is good to keep this idea in mind.

I was discussing my general process and ended up doing a video to walk through it as well as some opportunities I see. Summary below:

1. I always start with reviewing my portfolio and making sure nothing is in need of immediate adjustments. Typically trades expiring soon, shorts that I want to take down for profits, etc. 
2. Next I make sure that my deltas haven't moved too extreme - we need to make sure our directional risk hasn't dramatically changed beyond our preferences. If so, delta adjustments are prudent here.
3. Finally the fun part! We get to go bargain shopping for things of interest. I tend to focus on products I favor to the long side vice short to take advantage of increased volatility. Absolutely similar to catching a falling knife, however I'm not concerned with how things do over the next week or two. I have a longer time-frame and only trade products that I'm willing to interact with for the next few months if adjustments are needed.

What is everyone else looking at? I'll can share the video for those interested, just let me know - I don't sell anything they're just for interaction. If you don't like the video, don't go to it - not a big deal.

A few years back i was young and really stupid. I made an account on an CFD broker, Plus500. I proceeded to deposit less than 50$ and shorted a couple positions because i was dumb and had no idea what shorting really is. I still don’t know much but i know a bit better.

The next day i received an email saying that my positions where close to a margin call and if i wish to close my positions. I immediately closed all of them. Then i did some research that i should have done before i shorted these positions and started panicking when i realized that short means loaning the investment. So i never used the site again and disabled the advertising emails. 

Fast forward i never heard from them again but from times to times it’s coming back on my memory how stupid i was and if i could be in trouble of that. 

So my question is, could i be in trouble? Could i owe them money?  

I logged into that account to check and the balance is 0, no negative values whatsoever.

However, someone pointed out that it helps others connect with my progress. Here it goes. I’m 29 now, live in a $2mm house, have rental properties, am an active investor, angel investor, and title investor. My life didn’t start this way. I did not come from anything special - which is why I think this person wanted me to share my background. To show it’s possible for folks. I was an active Marine Officer for 5.5 years now in the reserves.

I started investing in high school (2007). I grew up with a single mom, alcoholic dad, and we lived very much paycheck time paycheck. I never wanted, always had a roof, food, and a loving mom. I was also taught that if someone called I didn’t know and asked for mom, she wasn’t home (debt collectors). 

I split wood as a kid and saved as much as I could. A mentor of mine suggested I looked into investing - suggesting that it would help me down the line. I looked into it and started an account under my dads name. I started with just long stock positions for about a year. 

I have an obsessive personality - once I find value in something I dig in. So once I started seeing my account grow, I chose to learn more. I got into derivatives and started to papertrade having a lot of issues with consistency. I took to Facebook to try and get help. Most folks made fun of me, a good amount wanted to sell me things, but a few didn’t. I still talk to these mentors today - without them, I wouldn’t be a successful trader

I worked with one mentor extensively. For hours on end trying to learn what I was doing. He was older, sarcastic, and pointed. A great teacher. After working with him for around a year, I started trading (2008 right before the drop). My account reduced by 67% but thanks to him, I didn’t make any rash decisions. We continued developing my trading plan and I closed out 2008 with a small loss, my only loss. Since then, I’ve been refining my plan and executing. My current CAGR is 19.44%, from 2007-2019. 

Now I started a YouTube channel to pay forward what my mentors did for me. I hope this answers the mail on my background - and more importantly allows others to know they can replicate what I’ve done. I’m not the brightest, have done nothing extraordinarily, but have worked hard to develop a plan and consistently execute.

,Trading,"In 2019 Ferrari delivered 10,131 cars; more than ever before. Since Ferrari went public in 2015, the stock has been on a climb, rising 350% in the five years since IPO. The luxury market has historically been defensive towards market downturns, as was shown during the 2008 financial crisis, where Ferrari only lost about 7% of sales from 20008-2009. Relative to some other companies, RACE dipped only moderately as Italy bore the brunt of coronavirus but has since recovered to pre-corona highs after reopening in mid-May.

Ferrari is soon to transform into a massively high growth company. The company has announced a plethora of new cars, including a newly announced SUV. Previously, Ferrari strayed away from the SUV realm. However, new management at Ferrari sees vast potential in the SUV market. While the general auto market has seen a decline in output in the past years, the SUV market has seen immense growth. In 2014 SUVs represented 22.4% (16.66M) of the auto market compared to 36.4% (29.77M) in 2018. As Ferrari reaches into this new territory, they are destined to grow as demand for SUVs skyrockets.

In 2018 Ferrari announced an entirely new product line of cars in addition to their Sport/Special Series and GT series known as the Icona series. The Icona series went on sale in 2019 as a series of very unique limited edition cars that embrace the history of Ferrari. This limited series of cars his highly profitable due to the limited series and helped raise profits in 2019 and will continue to do so in the future.

Ferrari has also recently announced a new car that is more accessible to the general public known as the Ferrari Roma. This car is poised to offer competition towards offerings from Porsche for the first time. As Ferrari dives into more accessible pricing brackets, its brand recognition will help them grow immensely. Also, Ferrari has announced plans to enter the electric car market in 2025 and will undoubtedly have success due to the quality of the Ferrari brand. The new emphasis on electric cars comes in stark contrast to the Ferrari of just five years ago, which was uninterested in electric car development.

With 898 million euro in cash before 2019 and a 650 million euro debt offering released on May 21st, Ferrari has ample liquidity to weather any unforeseen economic downturns. With plants reopened following strict social distancing guidelines and cases in Italy trending lower and lower, Ferrari seems poised to rise over the long-term as they expand into more attractive and accessible market segments. Perhaps Ferrari will take over Porsche or Mercedes as the dominant luxury car manufacturer in the world.

,Trading,"I've heard many market pundits say ""the financial system is getting more chaotic - more volatile"", and while I agree that it FEELS that way, I would argue that they have simply become LESS RATIONAL.

Markets used to be driven by 20-30 key EXPERIENCED and KNOWLEDGEABLE ""Masters of the Universe"" and an army of MBAs. They would go to work, look at the news - make decisions about what that means for ""the Markets"" - and ACT in a rational way.

Now, the Market is run by boys and girls that managed to parlay the $20 they stole from their Mom's purse into $2,000 simply by downloading an app, typing ""what should I buy"" into the echo chamber that is WSB/etc - and riding the inevitable trend. A monkey could literally achieve the same results.

How did they do it? They don't know. And like Eamon and ""I don't Want You Back"" - bitches are one hit wonders.

The OTHER HALF (or more) of the Markets, these days - is driven by Computers. Systems designed implicitly to soak pennies out of WHATEVER direction the Market is going - not terribly different than the kiddies with apps.

,Trading,"Hi

I’m new to trading and would appreciate some advice on a recent matter. 

I placed a pending order out of market hours to buy 3 separate stocks. As soon as the market opened all three stocks shot up through the roof and my pending orders triggered at the top of the spikes, much higher than the price I had set and agreed to pay. 

My question is, does the trading platform have the right/authority to do this? Surely if the trade cannot be completed at the price I’ve set, for whatever reason, then the order should be cancelled? 

Obviously, due to this I am now largely in the red. I need to know if I have an argument to fight this or if I’m wasting my time? 

Thank you in advance!

,Trading,"I recently got a question on the concept of edge and how we create it is traders. Edge does exist, we know from empirical research. We also know it's elusive. I made a video outlining my approach to developing edge as a trader and reviewed a study (from 2017) regarding day trading "" Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?"" In short, our long term profitability depends on our capacity to develop an edge.

Below is a summary of what I covered in the video:

\- We need a detailed understanding of the market we're trading. Don't spread yourself too thin trying to trade everything. Don't narrow yourself too much either. Fine what works for you.

\- Structure positively expectant trades. Many trades by nature are not positively expectant and need management applied.

\- Document experience to increase pattern recognition. (This is empirical, not Erik's opinion)

\- Control variables. We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails. Leverage your trading plan to analyze what you're doing and make minor adjustments as needed. Observe, document, and adjust again as necessary.

Below is the conclusion of the study | link: [https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf)

"" We test predictions of models of learning by rational traders and find clear evidence that the decision to continue or increase day trading is influenced by previous day trading returns. Nevertheless, rational models of learning do not explain all or even most day trading. The most experienced day traders lose money and nearly 3/4ths of day trading can be traced to traders with a history of losses. Persistent trading in the face of losses is inconsistent with models of rational learning. So, too, is the decision to try day trading when ex-ante expected lifetime profits are negative. For prospective day traders, “trading to learn” is no more rational or profitable than playing roulette to learn. ""

,Trading,"Last week Boeing announced they were going to be laying off 6,770 employees as part of the first wave of involuntary layoffs. This reduction in staff may seem to be a significant negative for Boeing and indeed, is a large negative for the short-term investor. However, in the long-term, this layoff (in combination with voluntary layoffs last month) will allow Boeing to emerge from this downturn as a more efficient company as the company focuses on profits during this difficult time.

Also, last week, we learned that Boeing had reached a significant milestone regarding the over a yearlong 737 MAX grounding as they resumed aircraft production. Boeing has begun production of this aircraft, albeit at a shallow rate, focusing on methodologies to enhance quality and plans to ramp production this year. As the 737 MAX is a significant source of revenue and profit for Boeing, the resumption of production is a sign that recertification is on the horizon.

Over the last two days, the stock has seen substantial gains driven by news that airlines are finally on the upswing as more people are flying in comparison to the lows reached last month. However, even in light of substantial gains, the stock remains 40% off pre-corona highs, and over 50% from all-time highs reached in mid-2019. With Boeing gaining $25 billion from one of the most extensive debt offerings in history, they will have access to plenty of funds to withstand this downturn with no government aid.

As production of the 737 MAX continues, and Boeing becomes more efficient from an employment perspective, Boeing is positioned to become even more valuable than before this pandemic.

Gamestop, despite speculation that digital sales have driven stronger-than-expected earnings (in light of in-store sales tanking), will miss expectations.\n2. Gamestop's digital sales will prove to be a short-term saving grace for the company, driving an earnings beat but a less-than optimistic forward guidance for the remainder of the year.\n3. Gamestop's digital sales will prove to be a short-term saving grace for the company, driving an earnings beat and greater forward guidance for the upcoming console cycle.\n4. Gamestop will crush earnings with their spike in digital sales, improve forward guidance and expectations for the console cycle, and potentially have laid the framework for their 2.0 business model.\n\nBased on earnings estimates, it is more likely than not that Gamestop will either miss the high bar set by analysts following their spike in digital sales (1) or beat earnings with no significant improvement in full-year guidance (2). In both of these scenarios, there is significant downside that has followed the stock quarter to quarter the last few years. If Gamestop can somehow leverage the COVID pandemic to create the necessary foundation for their revised business model, this earnings report could result in the short-squeeze bulls have been speculating about since January (current short float of 96.8%), but it is less than likely.\n\nOverall, considering that any sales boost resulting from COVID has been eagerly priced into earnings, there is significant short-term downside to $GME.

I believe that the halls of power, especially of this administration, are laden with large institutional investors who at times seem to work as an extension of the Fed. (Blackstone).

It's not a secret that the hottest trade for Institutions over the course of the low interest oughts, has been the Carry Trade. 

A trade that works just fine if the Home currency goes down, but gets all but wiped out if it goes up against the carried currency.

Carry Trades are implicitly tied to debt. Almost every crisis we have surrounds debt in some way - its why the Fed focuses on QE and the like.

But you can protect debt 2 important ways right now: buy debt on the market, and make sure the existing debt doesn't default.

If the Fed and major Institutions worked together they could (and in my opinion have) artificially hold down the Dollar, even in the midst of a crisis that calls for all a crash, and a dollar surge.

I was reading about oil futures speculation and was wondering if anyone could clarify my understanding of the two below points. I’m not looking to trade oil futures at the moment. 

1) Is the price difference from which money is made from when the value of a contract increases due to the underlying price of oil increasing, then this is sold before the maturity to gain the difference? As I understand this, the original contracts terms (such as the price which the seller is guaranteed to receive) will remain the same, and the clearing house will credit the buyer if the price increased. 

2) Although when speculating there is only a cash settlement meaning no physical delivery of oil, what happens to the underlying oil itself at maturity? I know opposite contracts can cancel themselves out, but I assume some contracts mature without cancellation.

,Trading,"Hi all, I just started swing trading two weeks ago (been investing for about 2 years), up about 12% but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just getting lucky without doing my due diligence so I was wondering if I could get some advice. My timeline for swing trading is anywhere from 1 day to 1 month and I don’t plan on shorting any time soon until I get more comfortable. I’m also targeting up to 5 trades a week, but this week I did 4 and last week was 2.

Here’s my procedure:

1. Typicalily, I would look at a particular sector, see what the trend is, and then pick high volume/low cost stocks, usually blue chips/mid-cap/growth stocks.
2. Once I find a stock, I look at the 1D, 2D, 5D, 10D, 1M charts to identify potential buying points, comparing them with past data to see likelihood. I use 50EMA, 200SMA, RSI, ADX and MACD for my indicators to help with making that call. I do some news research as well, but I place most of my time on the technicals.
3. Once I determine an entry point, I punch in the number of shares I can buy at the buy price in my spreadsheet and it spits out stop losses (-1% of total portfolio value PV) and target sells (+3% of PV). These are computed based on the PV at the time and whatever that % is, I divide by the number of shares to get the change which I can use to determine the stop loss and target sell. So for example, let’s say I have $100 and I want to buy 20 shares of a stock that costs $1. My stop loss would be at $0.95 (1% PV loss is $1 so if I have 20 shares and price goes down to $0.95, then I’m at a loss of 1% overall); my target sell would be computed similarly except +3%.
4. Once I hit 3%, I would sell. I don’t think I would sell if there is a price drop, I’d probably hold for however long it takes to get back to stop loss or original buy price unless there is news that suggests a potential rally.

I get that as my portfolio gets larger, so too would the stop loss and target sell prices but I would be able to compensate for that by buying more shares/cheaper stocks.

I’m also having trouble pulling the trigger on trades so if there’s anything else I should be doing, I would appreciate the advice!

Thanks!

Is this acceptable? How do you guys come up with the idea to trade a particular stock?",t2_dmmr2,False,,0,False,Trading Strategy,[],r/Trading,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_gt9527,False,dark,1.0,,public,14,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,self,1590856306.0,,[],{},,True,,1590846983.0,text,6,,,text,self.Trading,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I just started swing trading two weeks ago (been investing for about 2 years), up about 12% but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just getting lucky without doing my due diligence so I was wondering if I could get some advice. My timeline for swing trading is anywhere from 1 day to 1 month and I don’t plan on shorting any time soon until I get more comfortable. I’m also targeting up to 5 trades a week, but this week I did 4 and last week was 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typicalily, I would look at a particular sector, see what the trend is, and then pick high volume/low cost stocks, usually blue chips/mid-cap/growth stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I find a stock, I look at the 1D, 2D, 5D, 10D, 1M charts to identify potential buying points, comparing them with past data to see likelihood. I use 50EMA, 200SMA, RSI, ADX and MACD for my indicators to help with making that call. I do some news research as well, but I place most of my time on the technicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I determine an entry point, I punch in the number of shares I can buy at the buy price in my spreadsheet and it spits out stop losses (-1% of total portfolio value PV) and target sells (+3% of PV). These are computed based on the PV at the time and whatever that % is, I divide by the number of shares to get the change which I can use to determine the stop loss and target sell. So for example, let’s say I have $100 and I want to buy 20 shares of a stock that costs $1. My stop loss would be at $0.95 (1% PV loss is $1 so if I have 20 shares and price goes down to $0.95, then I’m at a loss of 1% overall); my target sell would be computed similarly except +3%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I hit 3%, I would sell. I don’t think I would sell if there is a price drop, I’d probably hold for however long it takes to get back to stop loss or original buy price unless there is news that suggests a potential rally.&lt;/li&gt;

For instance, in a green candle, price could have opened, increased to the candle high, decreased down to the candle low, and then rebounded to the level it closed at. Or it could have done the opposite - first opened, then decreased to the low, increased to the high, and then closed.

Since candlestick charts are so ubiquitously used among traders, does it matter that we don't know the chronological story of price action within the time period of a given candle (1M, 5M, Daily charts) when reading a chart?

,Trading,"CFD providers are reporting a significant increase in new clients because of Covid-19. Whilst most seasoned traders understand the difference between DMA (Direct Market Access) and Market Maker pricing, I'm sure many have opened accounts with the likes of CMC Markets, City Index and IG Markets without reading the PDS (Product Disclosure Statement).

A CFD or Contract for Difference is an agreement between you and your provider to exchange the difference in price of an asset between when the contract is opened and when it is closed. The CFD product is simple to understand and offers considerable amounts of leverage enabling traders to take out positions much larger than if you purchased the underlying product.

Now in the beginning, CFD providers charged a fee for opening and closing a position in exactly the same way a broker would charge in order to buy and sell ordinary equities. If you wanted access to live prices, you needed to pay an exchange fee.

As CFDs became more popular, CFD providers began innovating the product in order to generate profit. The providers decided to enter into agreements with real banks and financial institutions in order to hedge their exposure and make more money by taking the opposite position to what was being traded.

This still wasn't enough for CFD providers who again changed the product by charging a spread (the difference between the buy price and sell price). The major banks / financial institutions who partnered with the CFD provider in order to hedge were not charged a spread.

This, again, was still not enough for many providers. 

CFD providers began the unthinkable and decided to charge their own price for the underlying instrument! This meant that it was now possible for providers to not only take the opposite sides of the buy / sell price using liquidity partners, but also adjust the price of the CFD to any amount they want. It was now possible to increase the price of a CFD trade to a level high / low enough to hit your stop losses before adjusting it back to whatever the market price was. 

I would consider the above to constitute fraud if it wasn't so clearly described in their Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), a document that obviously many people do not read.

**DMA CFDs**

DMA (Direct Market Access) CFD providers offer a much, much better product. Upon placing an order, the provider typically places the same order into the underlying market. The prices quoted are the same as the underlying and you can even see your trade in the order book. 

Most DMA CFD providers charge:

1. Minimum Deposit
2. Platform Fee
3. Exchange Data Fee
4. A fee to buy / sell

In my opinion, I would much rather pay the fees quoted if it meant I was actually trading the financial markets instead of a price that can be changed in order to close out my positions at a loss whenever the computers at CMC feel like it.

**DMA CFD Providers**

Some DMA CFD providers include:

Whilst most seasoned traders understand the difference between DMA (Direct Market Access) and Market Maker pricing, I&amp;#39;m sure many have opened accounts with the likes of CMC Markets, City Index and IG Markets without reading the PDS (Product Disclosure Statement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CFD or Contract for Difference is an agreement between you and your provider to exchange the difference in price of an asset between when the contract is opened and when it is closed. The CFD product is simple to understand and offers considerable amounts of leverage enabling traders to take out positions much larger than if you purchased the underlying product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in the beginning, CFD providers charged a fee for opening and closing a position in exactly the same way a broker would charge in order to buy and sell ordinary equities. If you wanted access to live prices, you needed to pay an exchange fee.&lt;/p&gt;

,Trading,"Hi Reddit

I'm a Day Trader of 15 years. I trade primarily futures contracts and ordinary equities.

I am asked the same question repeatedly - What do I need in order to become successful?

**Capital**

You need at least $100,000.00 in order to have any chance of becoming a successful trader. You will need to understand that this money is not for investing or trading, it's for educational purposes. Many people spend circa $100,000 on university degrees in order to learn specific skillsets that may or may not be relevant to what you would like to do / become.

**Time**

You need to be willing to spend at least 12 hours of work every trading day. Here is my schedule:

6:00 am: Wake up, have coffee whilst watching the close of the US markets.

7:00 am: Shower, read the Australian Financial Review online.

8:00 am: I begin planning.

9:00 am: I switch on my computer and ensure my internet connection is working by conducting a speed test. I ensure there are no pending Windows Updates and begin opening software and apps.

9:30 am: I finish my planning and begin preparing for the open.

9:50 am: I start generating trade ideas.

10:00am: The ASX opens.

4:00pm: The ASX closes.

5:00pm: I take a look at what positions I've got open, what positions I've got closed and allow myself 30 minutes to rest and recover.

6:00pm: I journal, might write a blog and try to switch off.

6:00pm - 6:00 am: During my down-time I'm still always connected to the markets. My phone provides live notifications.

10:00pm: I take a look at the futures market and watch a little bit of the financial news / television.

11:00pm: I should be asleep - if I'm not asleep either something major is happening overseas or I haven't taken enough Xanax.

**Equipment**

You will need the fastest internet you can find. If you are using WiFi in order to trade, you haven't done your homework. Make sure you have a contingency plan for when your internet goes down.

Get the fastest laptop you can afford! You will need a laptop over a desktop so that when the power goes out you can still access the markets. Don't buy an Apple product - get a Lenovo ThinkPad.

**Broker**

Finding the right broker takes time. I personally have around 5 accounts open with different brokers as each tends to specialise in a specific market.

Your broker should offer you either a free demonstration account or at the very least some sort of training.

In Australia, we have what is called a Product Disclosure Statement or PDS. A PDS contains crucial information regarding the terms and conditions of your account. You should absolutely read the PDS and study it prior to opening a position. I personally have been burned twice now because I failed to read the PDS with a critical mindset and had a different definition to my broker as to what constituted the price of an instrument.

**Mindset**

Trading the financial markets is open to anyone. You will get burned repeatedly - even by your broker. You are a retail day trader at the very bottom of the food chain. Any trade you make that becomes profitable in the first 4 years is a miracle and should be treated as such.

Becoming a successful, profitable Day Trader requires the same amount of education, practical experience and time as that of any other professional in any other industry. Trading attracts the brightest, smartest, most intelligent of people. Generally speaking, these people get snapped up by the very companies you will be trading against. You need to be the best, the top 1% in order to succeed.

**Bloomberg Professional**

As a newbie, you won't be able to afford this and that is OK. But you should be working towards getting a terminal in your home office.

Having a Bloomberg Professional subscription changed the way I thought about and traded the markets. You will gain access to the same data, at the same time as most Wall Street firms. You will be connected to and able to chat with the biggest players in the financial markets.

I view the $24,000 a year + exchange data as being an ""entry fee"". I cannot really trade without it.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a Day Trader of 15 years. I trade primarily futures contracts and ordinary equities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am asked the same question repeatedly - What do I need in order to become successful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need at least $100,000.00 in order to have any chance of becoming a successful trader. You will need to understand that this money is not for investing or trading, it&amp;#39;s for educational purposes. Many people spend circa $100,000 on university degrees in order to learn specific skillsets that may or may not be relevant to what you would like to do / become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be willing to spend at least 12 hours of work every trading day. Here is my schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:00 am: Wake up, have coffee whilst watching the close of the US markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:00 am: Shower, read the Australian Financial Review online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:00 am: I begin planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:00 am: I switch on my computer and ensure my internet connection is working by conducting a speed test. I ensure there are no pending Windows Updates and begin opening software and apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:30 am: I finish my planning and begin preparing for the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:50 am: I start generating trade ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:00am: The ASX opens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:00pm: The ASX closes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:00pm: I take a look at what positions I&amp;#39;ve got open, what positions I&amp;#39;ve got closed and allow myself 30 minutes to rest and recover.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last few years, he's started to trade a pretty big book made up of mainly family friends and crypto connections. All in about $1m. So far, he's built his edge to be pretty directional where he earns alpha on both up and down cycles. I'm guessing he's done quite well since he has about $25m committed and another $20m to call in over the next few months. He's offered me a seat to trade on behalf of his fund and I'm a little unsure.

To give some background, I've accepted a quant trading offer at a HF focused on energy markets which I'm supposed to start in about a month. My background is in math and machine learning. 

Obviously, the upside to this opportunity is quite big as I'd be one of the first traders in a startup HF, however, there is a fair amount of risk as it'd be a fund founded by people in their 20's who haven't traded through major recessions/corrections and are less equipped to navigate the impending recession that we will face. Given that they have $20m called in, I have confidence that they have a Strat thats profitable and proprietary but I realize that they're trading against top quant funds who most likely understand the market better.

But I think there is a competitive advantage to be had, somewhere, someway. Right? Markets cannot be 100% efficient: dissemination of information is not perfect. What if then, we could attempt to find this competitive advantage. We could backtrack to previous earnings, evaluate current earnings, and screen across different fundamentals to see if there are any discernible trends. What could go wrong.\n\nSo, I sought to ignorantly invest in all companies reporting earnings over the week of 5/11 to 5/15, and evaluate whether there were any interesting insights we could come up with.\n\n# Methodology:\n\nAs you can tell from the title, this post is Part 1 of an ongoing series of posts, week to week, evaluating earnings under this lens. With this being said, the methodology I use in this first week is...primitive (to say the least) but will be refined week to week, targeting an end goal of identifying an observable trend.\n\n1. **Timeline.** For this report, I will be evaluating earnings reports covering the trading week beginning 5/11 and ending 5/15. In the future, I plan on backtesting previous weeks once we\'ve refined our methodology. For the time being, we will be forward looking.\n2. **What Earnings to ""Play?""** For this analysis, I will be referencing earningswhispers.com\'s ""**Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the trading week beginning \\[insert Monday of chosen week\\]""** earnings calendar. If you aren\'t familiar with r/EarningsWhispers, they create weekly earnings ""calendars"" that detail popular companies\' earnings reports for a given week, organized based on date and time of release (before market open or after market close). Having worked in-depth with their calendars while setting up this analysis, I feel that their calendars represent a solid mixture of companies, specifically diverse in risk (value/growth), market capitalization (large/small/micro), and sectors, and industries. For this report, I will be referencing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWhispers/comments/gghsn7/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the/) earnings calendar. If there are any recommendations for services with more comprehensive report coverage, please let me know.\n3. **Investment Size.** To ensure that we were able to buy into all companies (no matter how high their share price was), I designated $1000 per investment. I tested again using $100 per investment, and the percentage difference was negligible. Besides, with fractional shares accessible on major platforms, investment size is less about concern and more about standardizing the return % we get.\n4. **Security of Choice and Holding Period.** For my first iteration of this project, I decided to invest using common stocks instead of options. Although options are the go-to choice for playing earnings, I figured starting with fewer variables, i.e. common stocks, would be a good foundation. Later on, I\'d be interested in redoing these scenarios with options. For each stocks\' holding period, I chose a 24-hour timeframe in order to minimize non-earnings influences. My rationale was as follows. For BO stock, purchasing the stock at close the day before the pre-market earnings release would reasonably approximate the markets anticipation of earnings pre-market and reaction to earnings through the following trading day, eliminating the impact of non-earnings news as much as possible. I applied this same rationale to the AO stock, however it is more difficult to approximate because the market\'s accessibility to anticipation/reaction prices is flipped: anticipation for a BO stock is purely institutional investors (while reaction comes from the broader market) while anticipation for an AO stock comes from the broader market (while the subsequent reaction following earnings is from after-hours trading). Being said, I\'m considering playing around with different holding periods to more efficiently block out non-earnings movement and encompass earnings movement. If you have any suggestions, drop below. The investment schedule is as follows (modeling the beginning of the week):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5/8/20 4:00 PM - Purchased BO Stock\n\n5/11/20 9:30 AM - Purchased AO Stock\n\n5/11/20 4:00PM - Sold BO Stock\n\n5/12/20 9:30AM - Sold AO Stock\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReiterating above, this methodology is very basic, but will be improved as we go forward. From the below results, I already have a few interesting ideas for future earnings investments, including: purchasing based on P/E versus industry P/E, sector, revisions in last 30 days, RSI, 72 hour holding period, etc.\n\n# Data:\n\n|Date|Before Market Return|After Market Return|Total Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5/11|(-$229/$8934): -2.56%|($1381/$9816): 14.1%|($1152/$18571): 6%|\n|5/12|(-$277/$9880): -2.81%|(-$226/$8881): -2.54%|(-$503/$18761): -2.6%|\n|5/13|($650/$8951): 7.26%|($-531/$8808): -6.02%|($119/$17760): 0.6%|\n|5/14|($360/$9791): 3.69%|($975/$8870): 11%|($1336/$18662): 7.1%|\n|5/15|(-$98/$8953): 1.00%|N/A|(-$98/$8953): 1.00%|\n|Total|||($2006/$82887): 2.40%|\n|Total|**DOW:** \\-2.30%|**SPY:** \\-1.50%|**Earnings:** 2.40%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Date|Largest BM Mover|Largest AM Mover|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|5/11|\\-9.7% ($UAA)|96.97% ($NVAX)|\n|5/12|20.3% ($NSPR), -19.32% ($CSPR)|28.37% ($ISR)|\n|5/13|35% ($EFOI)|\\-20% ($SDC)|\n|5/14|25.3% ($ETM)|49.1% ($ACB)|\n|5/15|15.5% ($DKNG)|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Positive Gains|Negative Gains|Neutral Gains|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|40|43|2|\n\n# Results:\n\nDespite the fact that our earnings investments outperformed the market last week, there are a few anomalies to account for. Most importantly, the average positive gain was larger than the average negative gain. Despite the fact there were more negative gains, positive gains usually sent the stock proportionally higher. This is demonstrated through major movers like $NVAX and $ACB, which made up 73% ($1450/$2006) of total gains for the week. As I continue to comb through the results, I will update this section of the post. If you find anything interesting, please comment and I will add it.\n\nIf you would like to see the raw data, the spreadsheet is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wIfzRnjqUy6_xfuecrfECEskgLy1UcAG8KrmaZH-DJA/edit?usp=sharing).

This is demonstrated through major movers like $NVAX and $ACB, which made up 73% ($1450/$2006) of total gains for the week.

This supports the thesis that the upside of a positive earnings response is greater than the downside of a negative earnings response.\n\n\\-Despite the fact the earnings return underperformed the broader market 2 of the 5 weeks (4/13 + 4/20), the earnings returns were never negative (albeit it got close 4/27). This supports the thesis that the optimism surrounding companies\' earnings acts as a hedge against broader market unfavorability.\n\n\\-As was brought to my attention in my last post, because the holding period for each stock is no more than 24 hours, in future posts total earnings returns will need to be discounted for capital gains taxes. This demonstrates the advantage of passive indexing + not having to worry about often turnover. I believe that even considering capital gains, the earnings results of the last 5 weeks will still outperform the broader markets, but we will see in the next post.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Applying Our Methodology to Low-Beta Companies + Going Forward**\n\nThe last few weeks of research have led me to believe that putting together a formal investment vehicle for this methodology, such as an ETF, would be difficult considering the lack of upside potential residing in fundamentally proven companies. ETFs that focus on trading within the S&amp;P or DOW are inherently disadvantaged from a return perspective. But I would argue that under the right portfolio formation (following the diversified earnings schedule we\'ve followed the last 5 weeks), we can sustain an outperformance of the broader market over the long term.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I will apply this methodology to the current 505 companies in the S&amp;P, going from 2008 to 2019. This will be the subject matter of my next post (along with continued backtesting on the ""most anticipated earnings"" investment approach). In anticipation of conducting this research, I chose $WYNN (which has been in the S&amp;P since 2008) to experiment with returns. As the results show (fair warning, this is 1 of 505 companies. extrapolating from this is ignorant on my part), there is legitimacy to the argument that attempting to apply this earnings report methodology to low-beta companies will NOT outperform the market.\n\n**$WYNN Returns (10/29/08 to 5/9/19)**\n\n||Earnings|S&amp;P|DOW|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Return|123.60% (not including capital gains)|213.55%|176.98%|\n|Annualized Return|11.18%|||\n|Average Earnings Movement|1.796%|||\n\n[Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ikkxjrtz0wXacKfyPvIPcHQ0LihCkJv-nu1Q1s-2Yos/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a preliminary test, this reflects poorly on the potential of applying this methodology to the S&amp;P and DOW. It very well may be that $WYNN is an exception: we will see next week.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, a lot of the information discovered so far is a generous extrapolation. But we are objectively getting closer to clear answers regarding how this methodology may perform over the long-term. Over the next few weeks, we will be working on filling in the S&amp;P\'s returns from \'08 to \'19 using this methodology, along with applying this methodology to ""anticipated earnings releases"" over an extended period of time as we\'ve done for the last five weeks.\n\nAs always, please let me know what you think!', 'author_fullname': 't2_6788o5ac', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Playing the Earnings Calendar: An Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing [Pt.2: Multi-Week Returns + Unique Insights]', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'DD'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/wallstreetbets', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 0, 'link_flair_css_class': 'dd', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_go7y81', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'upvote_ratio': 0.92, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 42, 'total_awards_received': 1, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'DD', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 42, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_1': 1}, 'post_hint': 'self', 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1590132795.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 0, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.wallstreetbets', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Playing the Earnings Calendar: An Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing [Pt.2: Multi-Week Returns + Unique Insights]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl464q/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I laid the foundation for the &amp;quot;Analysis of Ignorant Earnings Investing&amp;quot; project, where we ignorantly invest in earnings, with well-defined conditions under a well-defined time period, and evaluate the returns.

As the results show (fair warning, this is 1 of 505 companies. extrapolating from this is ignorant on my part), there is legitimacy to the argument that attempting to apply this earnings report methodology to low-beta companies will NOT outperform the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$WYNN Returns (10/29/08 to 5/9/19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Earnings&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;S&amp;amp;P&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=""left""&gt;DOW&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Return&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;123.60% (not including capital gains)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;213.55%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;176.98%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Annualized Return&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;11.18%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Average Earnings Movement&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.796%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ikkxjrtz0wXacKfyPvIPcHQ0LihCkJv-nu1Q1s-2Yos/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;Link to spreadsheet with specific day to day breakdowns.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a preliminary test, this reflects poorly on the potential of applying this methodology to the S&amp;amp;P and DOW.

But we are objectively getting closer to clear answers regarding how this methodology may perform over the long-term. Over the next few weeks, we will be working on filling in the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s returns from &amp;#39;08 to &amp;#39;19 using this methodology, along with applying this methodology to &amp;quot;anticipated earnings releases&amp;quot; over an extended period of time as we&amp;#39;ve done for the last five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, please let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'preview': {'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cmLH5_KhNpwuUXn0_L5DIhSm5epCL070q6Txqz5c5Ro.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=27cae616f896fab4438f69a43f28967881f190c7', 'width': 192, 'height': 192}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cmLH5_KhNpwuUXn0_L5DIhSm5epCL070q6Txqz5c5Ro.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a59d442517fe2a7de37b209f6f0f99373690086f', 'width': 108, 'height': 108}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'zcxtbc2oJ6aU3Oi_qaGrQRE7Yp7xzBH4hoZq-RlMgdA'}], 'enabled': False}, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 100, 'resized_tier_icons': None, 'id': 'gid_1', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'static_icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': ""Shows the Silver Award... and that's it."", 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'name': 'Silver', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '5692ce02-b860-11e5-b542-0edc7016bbd3', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2th52', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#365b8c', 'id': 'go7y81', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'imattractedtodcfs', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 16, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1459100, 'created_utc': 1590103995.0, 'num_crossposts': 6, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go7y81/playing_the_earnings_calendar_an_analysis_of/,t3_go7y81

Obviously CUK is good. Normally the price hovers around $40, but it dropped to around $11 since the quarantine started, halting all cruise ships. I have a $16 call for September, when they are expected to open back up.

F, price got cut in half, went from 10 a share to $5 a share. $6 call for june. Obviously once they start making cars/selling them itll go up, like all of these though it's just a question of when.

SPG is another good one. Normally $120, currently $55. $110 call for Jan 2021 They deal with real estate for things like malls, outlets, etc. Most malls around the country are opening up, once that happens I expect a lot more to come.

,Trading,"**DAY AHEAD**

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:**

&lt;p&gt;In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.&lt;/p&gt;

So, apparently offshore Forex broker have an algorithm that take the opposite trade of theirs clients. When the client take a buy order, the broker take a sell order, when the client close the buy order, broker close the sell order. Knowing that more than 95% of Trader loose theirs money on the long term, offshore broker earn a lot of money just by doing that, and that why they don't care about giving clients small commission and small spread, because theirs get rich just by taking opposite trade.

Greetings,

Thank you for getting in touch with us.

I was able to review the case in-depth and it does appear that the loss was caused by the market opening with a gap, thus executing the order at the price of 36.65, which is the opening market price.

I would be glad if I was able to shed some light on the situation.

In case you would need further assistance, do not hesitate to contact us.

Good day Vasile, 

Further to my colleague's email, I would like to stress that there can be a few reasons why prices differ from one broker to another. The most common is likely to be the different spread set by different brokers, and, as a result, the buy and sell prices will differ between them. Some brokers may have different price feeds to others so the speed at which their prices update may differ. Another reason could be that some brokers base their prices on different contracts of the same instrument, which can also cause variations in price. 

I hope this information dispels any concerns you may have. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, check out our Help Centre or reach our team 24/7.

,Trading,"Hi guys.

I've been reading up a lot on EM sovereigns CDS spreads. So far the established facts are:
1. EM CDS spreads move in tandem more often than not. There are significant correlations between CDS spreads of geographically similarly situated countries
2. These CDS spreads are moved more by global factors than they are by the local markets of each sovereign.
3. There is a significant correlation between EM CDS and the SP500 and VIX.

However, these are already established facts in any EM trader's mind. Furthermore, the correlations are calculated from coincident CDS and equities time series. So the analysis does not help with pre-empting a CDS spread move and putting a trade on.

Is there any leading indicator for CDS spreads besides an obvious and worst-case scenario like a ""We might default or daily to pay on our debt"" call by the sovereign?

I am new to trading and am very interested in learning as much as I can.
The reason I'm asking for help is because I do not really understand all the principles fully. 

For example, at first I invested around 500chf which I lost within my first day. 
I then added another 1000chf which once again, I lost very short thereafter. 

I then decided to try it one more time and deposited 1000chf into my account. My current balance is now at 4200chf which is really great. I mean, with my little knowledge I don't think that I'm doing so badly. ( this was done in a time period of roughly 3 weeks )
