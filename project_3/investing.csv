,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,1,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,274,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,274,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

,investing,"For many years, I have been an advocate of the Three-Fund Portfolio and, in general, the Boglehead approach to investing.  Roughly 90% of my portfolio still exists in this format, with an allocation of 61% domestic, 14% international, and 25% bond.

Recently, I built up a model of all of my finances:

* ""static"" expenses (things that don't increase over time, like mortgage payments, student loan payments, and auto payments)
* ""dynamic"" expense (those that do increase over time with inflation, like daycare, property tax, and the electric bill
* Income, with a metric for annual increases
* Investments, with allocation, historical yield, and standard deviation

All of this was set to answer the question: ""When am I likely to be able to retire?""  The finish line would be based on the logic: 25 times the amount of ($100,000/year inflation adjusted plus any remaining ""static"" expenses).  So if the mortgage was the only expense left and you pay $50k a year on that, my target would be $150k * 25 = $3,750,000.  That allows me to pull 4% per year more or less forever.

The model was run on a monthly basis, proceeding until the mark is hit, stores the retirement age, and then repeats 10,000 times.  Each month, the monthly return is calculated for each investment vehicle by generating a normally distributed random number, multiplying that by the fund's standard deviation, and adding it to the weighted mean return.  In this way, I include all of the random walk of the market.

When putting in the numbers, something drastic stood out to me:

Fund|Annual Return|Standard Deviation
:-:|:-:|:-:
Domestic|7.84%|19.48%
International|4.27%|15.20%
Bond|5.28%|3.07%

Why the hell do I have any money in the international fund?  While not a ""complete"" data set, the International Fund source data is back to 1996, so it's a reasonable 24-year sample.  Yields are lower than bonds, with standard deviation 5x as high.

Where's the benefit?  ""Diversification"" by itself is a rough answer, especially given the weight that the US Market has on foreign markets.

&lt;p&gt;All of this was set to answer the question: &amp;quot;When am I likely to be able to retire?&amp;quot;  The finish line would be based on the logic: 25 times the amount of ($100,000/year inflation adjusted plus any remaining &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; expenses).  So if the mortgage was the only expense left and you pay $50k a year on that, my target would be $150k * 25 = $3,750,000.  That allows me to pull 4% per year more or less forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model was run on a monthly basis, proceeding until the mark is hit, stores the retirement age, and then repeats 10,000 times.  Each month, the monthly return is calculated for each investment vehicle by generating a normally distributed random number, multiplying that by the fund&amp;#39;s standard deviation, and adding it to the weighted mean return.  In this way, I include all of the random walk of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When putting in the numbers, something drastic stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""center""&gt;Fund&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""center""&gt;Annual Return&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""center""&gt;Standard Deviation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Domestic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;7.84%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;19.48%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;International&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;4.27%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;15.20%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Bond&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;5.28%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;3.07%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the hell do I have any money in the international fund?  While not a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; data set, the International Fund source data is back to 1996, so it&amp;#39;s a reasonable 24-year sample.  Yields are lower than bonds, with standard deviation 5x as high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where&amp;#39;s the benefit?  &amp;quot;Diversification&amp;quot; by itself is a rough answer, especially given the weight that the US Market has on foreign markets.  I&amp;#39;m struggling to make a solid argument to keep it in my portfolio at all.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Is there a ""best practice"" or at least a resource for good information regarding corporate actions like tender offers?

In general the legal wording make it difficult and time consuming to decipher

For example the latest tender offer from Ponos to owners of AT&amp;T (ticker: T) where it sounds like they are offering a premium of 20% ($36 compared to current price $30) but researching further I found below article clarifying that accepting the offer can only lead to loss because it will only take effect if the price is above $36 when it expires...

China is planning a sweeping set of new government policies to develop its domestic semiconductor industry and counter Trump administration restrictions, conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Beijing is preparing broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors for the five years through 2025, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing government deliberations. A suite of measures to bolster research, education and financing for the industry has been added to a draft of the country’s 14th five-year plan, which will be presented to the country’s top leaders in October, the people said.


China’s top leaders will gather next month to lay out their economic strategy for the next half decade, including efforts to ramp up domestic consumption and make critical technology at home. President Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to artificial intelligence. Semiconductors are fundamental to virtually every component of China’s technology ambitions -- and an increasingly aggressive Trump administration threatens to cut off their supply from abroad.

“The Chinese leadership realizes that semiconductors underpin all advanced technologies, and that it can no longer dependably rely on American supplies,” said Dan Wang, technology analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. “In the face of stricter U.S. restrictions on chip access, China’s response can only be to keep pushing its own industry to develop.”

,investing,"I briefly talked yesterday about Tesla's market cap and how it was absurdly priced and honestly felt like gambling to me. However, APPL is somewhat overlooked as well and I wanted to hear your guys' thoughts on it!

Apple's Market Cap as of right now is 2.3 Trillion ([Source](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap)). On August 20, it was 2 Trillion. It has added 300 billion in about 10 days - without having added any products what soever (primarily due to the stock split).

In April of this year, it was 1.1 Trillion or so. It has since doubled since that time, so much so that it is the size of the GDP of France ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/))

Now, I am all for Apple devices and services. They make some of the best products ever. They have crazy high margins and once a consumer buys an Apple device, he has to buy other ones due to the seamless integration it provides (biggest selling point). It is now getting in more markets such as India with its' new iPhone SE 2, but I am somewhat skeptical on its' valuation.

I feel like people are buying AAPL due to its security - it has always gone up, so it will always go up - and therefore, it's safe to park their money there. Some are even likening it to Treasury Bonds - that it's better to put your money in AAPL stock because it's *safe* and because it's so big, it won't fail.

Stocks rose on Wednesday, continuing a strong start to September for the market as traders took profits out of high-flying names like Apple and Tesla and snapped up shares in more beaten-down parts of the market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 300 points, or 1%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1% while the Nasdaq Composite was higher by 0.5%. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, with the Nasdaq topping 12,000 for the first time. 

Coca-Cola rose more than 3% along with IBM to lead the Dow higher. However, both of those stocks are still down year to date. Apple and Tesla slid 2.6% and 6.5%, respectively, giving back some of their recently sharp gains. The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) rose 1.1% to outperform its Growth counterpart.

Wall Street was coming off a banner session in which the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 also logged in its best first trading day of September since 2010, according to Bespoke Investment Group. 

Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Mike Wilson said Tuesday on “[Closing Bell](https://www.cnbc.com/closing-bell/)” that he was still optimistic about the market long-term but that weakness in the weeks ahead was on the table after such a strong rally.

Ride-hailing firm Uber has stepped up lobbying of the Hong Kong government after losing a critical court case on the legality of its business model, with some drivers vowing to keep carrying passengers despite the threat of an intensified crackdown.
In a letter to stakeholders, legislators and other policymakers on Tuesday, Uber’s local head of public policy and government affairs called on them to use their influence to persuade the government to change its stance on the company.
“As we face this critical and uncertain period, I hope that we can continue to count on your support so that Uber and our partners can carry on serving the millions of Hongkongers who rely on our apps,” Richard Wilder said.
“There are different ways that individuals can support Uber at this point, either by raising the issue with relevant stakeholders as you see fit or by submitting to the chief executive’s policy address consultation directly.”

The plea came after the Court of Final Appeal on Tuesday threw out the last-ditch bids of 24 Uber drivers who were found guilty of carrying passengers for hire or reward without a hire-car permit, and were fined between HK$3,000 (US$380) and HK$4,500 in 2018.
The defeat was a devastating blow to Uber, which has provided millions of trips to residents since arriving in 2014, as well as delivering food orders.
“We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision, and we will continue to support the 24 partners and their families during this challenging time,” Wilder said.

The senior executive admitted the top court’s ruling, coupled with a lack of regulatory progress on ride-sharing in Hong Kong, had “profound consequences” for Uber and the 14,000 active drivers who hoped to find flexible earning opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic.

“We know that the single most common reason for becoming a driver-partner is to make up for lost income during the current economic crisis, with the second most important reason being the need to meet ongoing obligations to support their families,” Wilder said.

\-This was a momentum play, and one I do quite often. I had done a similar 300% trade last week, playing it off earnings. Healthy consolidation and bull volume keep this stock in a safe uptrend.

Bought a $6.30/150 call for September 11th that I sold for $16.05. The other call is a long dated, out of the money, play that I will keep you updated on!

*“following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”*

When FED announced unlimited QE in mid-march, I didn't understand the implication of that and was still expecting for further market crash and reduced amount of my monthly investment. So would like to avoid the same mistake and analyze and discuss the implication of this major policy shift better.

Questions

1. Does this policy shift of allowing inflation higher than 2 % mean stocks are going to appreciate much more than expected before? Does this mean its prudent to invest now than wait for another corona related crash/Nov election crash?
2. What is the impact of this policy shift on other asset classes like bonds, metals etc compared to stocks?

,investing,"Mylan NV received a warning from U.S. regulators for failing to ensure key drug ingredients made at one of its plants in India were not contaminated.

The Food and Drug Administration recommended Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch hire a consultant to help the generic drugmaker improve its manufacturing practices, according to an Aug. 20 warning letter released Tuesday.

The FDA inspected Mylan’s facility in Pashamylaram, India, in February.

The agency found that the plant, which makes active ingredients for drugs, hadn’t taken the proper precautions to ensure solvents it used didn’t contain impurities, including failing to adequately test the raw materials.

FDA inspectors reported that Mylan’s testing found signs of impurities in its solvents but that the company failed to investigate further.

Mylan said in a statement that it had been working with the FDA since last fall to thoroughly investigate potential risks associated with inquiries related to impurities.

It's clear that in markets that trend sideways with lots of volatility the end result is a net negative for levered ETFs.  It's usually argued that overtime this decay will gradually erode the value of the investment. However, back testing a levered version of the S&amp;P500 seems to show otherwise (assuming a 1% expense ratio):

By doing so they were able to reduce volatility and improve return.

,investing,"Theoretically let's say I was going to buy 100 shares of a company I would have bought regardless since I believe in the companies potential, is there any way I would loss on selling the covered call aside from the two options listed below?

1. Losing from the potential stock gain. Might be a bit contradictory since if I believe in the company I should be holding the stocks regardless but I would want to have part of my portfolio for holding and the rest low risk decent reward covered calls. Technically in this scenario I wouldn't be paying a cost to front the shares as these are shares I would invest in regardless.

2. The stock price drops. The loss in this case would be I suppose losing value on the shares themselves but I would still cash in on the premium. Since these are stocks I believe in and would want to buy regardless I could in a sense just hold long term if it drops and just collect the premium no? In this case the loss would be no different than if I had just bought and held the shares outright without selling the covered call.

So putting these 2 risks of loss aside is there any other way I could make a loss selling a covered call? I understand it may be better to buy and hold the 100 shares if its a company I believe in but I wanted to find a very low risk method and with the cost of certain bids on blue chip stock it really seems like I could get a guaranteed 10-15% return monthly on certain stocks, assuming I would be willing to weather through and hold these 100 shares if the price were to drop anyways.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing from the potential stock gain.

Is that really something to boast about? Not to throw shade on their profitable trading and investment strategies but why does anyone take risk?

Let’s say you want to grow your wealth. How would you do that?

A. Invest in your education / network and get a high-paying job.

B. Take a risk on your existing wealth to get a 10% return (profit) or a 5% loss (assuming a conservative risk-reward ratio of 1:2)

Option B is often touted as ‘passive income’ whereas Option A is touted as ‘Active income’ aka ‘hard-earned money’. Which one is the better option? Would you conserve your ‘hard-earned money’ or would you risk it to earn a little more pocket money?

,investing,"Based on sales and demand data from more than 17 million members and millions of items sold, the report charts the current state of luxury resale and COVID-19’s impact on what consumers are buying and selling.

Sales growth of high-value items, across numerous categories, outpaced that of low-value:

-**High-value jewelry sales grew 22x more than low-value**

-**High-value handbag sales grew 2.4x more than low-value**

-**High-value watch sales grew 6x more than low-value**

For the second year in a row, Gucci and Louis Vuitton remain the most in-demand brands within luxury resale. Louis Vuitton edged its way over Gucci for the No. 1 spot for the first time, while Gucci remains the No. 1 Men’s brand for the third year in a row. Driven by a surge in demand for millennials and Gen Z, both brands continued to strengthen their lead over No. 3 brand Chanel.

“In a bright spot during these difficult times, brands, shoppers and consignors alike are engaging in the circular economy,” said Rati Levesque, COO and head of merchandising for The RealReal. “Gen Z, millennials and men are the new faces of luxury shopping, and the brands in tune with what they want are rising to the top.”

Other trends that rose to the top during COVID-19*:

**Stealth luxury favored over logomania:**

-Demand for understated handbags was nearly 5x stronger than that of statement handbags

-Sales for quieter men’s styles grew 2.4x more than statement styles

**Buyers embrace luxury labels’ streetwear designs:**

-Balenciaga becomes No. 1 brand in streetwear

-Demand for luxury streetwear spiked 486 percent in the past two years

**Buyers and sellers turn to Home/Art like never before:**

-Art consignment was up 150%

-Customers spent 26 percent more on home items compared to apparel, quarter-over-quarter

As brick-and-mortar came to a standstill, brands and retailers turned to luxury resale to connect with buyers and give new life to pieces past and present – **interest increased 22x during COVID-19.**

-New consignors during COVID-19* increased 27 percent, of which 37 percent were **millennials and Gen Z.**

,investing,"I come to r/investing hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it. I understand my post isn’t is not the typical r/investing post, but my post is meant to hopefully explain some things the r/investing crowd may not have heavy exposure to, which is options and how they are having a massive effect on certain stocks, particularly Tesla. 

So to begin with, I see way too many posts like P/E of stock XYZ is too high. Tesla is one of these XYZ stocks, but the market has changed. No one really cares about P/E anymore. All that matters is supply and demand and especially through options. Unfortunately, because of retail, the entire options market has changed the last few months, which probably changed the behavior of funds too, causing the entire market to change. Here’s a quick explanation using some options terminology of what I see is happening. 

Call volume is almost like 90% today and it’s historically skewed towards calls, especially calls that put pressure on the upside skew of the vol curve (which brings in kurtosis). That’s the only thing that matters. If people buy calls -&gt; the stock will keep going up because it’s natural float is so low and big players like Musk and Baron don’t sell to cause any selling pressure. 

The equity game has changed to the point most people are now making their bullish bets through options to gain max leverage. If there are a lot of people buying calls, that’s a bullish sentiment and so the stock will go up, just like when people buy a lot of shares. People have to get that in their heads that supply/demand is what drives price moves and options provide a leveraged version of supply and demand. 

The calls on Tesla cause the name to explode even more to the upside than a boring name like say an INTC because Tesla comes with the extra special convexity/kurtosis bonus in that if the stock goes up, volatility explodes and gamma explodes. Hence market makers now will have to be desperate to buy as many shares as possible to stay delta neutral to the new skew, causing a feedback loop to bring the stock even higher.

This is also easier to do the lower the stock price, since calls become more affordable to retail. Whether that was Elon’s motivation for splitting the stock or not is unknown, but he’s a smart guy. I’m sure he probably knows.

It could theoretically work in reverse too, going down through the same short strikes it went through, but you would need a major catalyst. A major QQQ selloff or some announcement that’s bad for Elon Musk could trigger a -20% selloff since it does work in reverse, but in a natural market environment, this should not happen.

Simple STRATEGY: The strategy IMO is to buy SHARES. Buying puts is probably a no-no but you could get lucky once in a while with timing. Shorting shares is definitely a no-no unless you want to go bankrupt. Buying calls could be really good if you time it right, but the main issue with buying the calls is you have to buy it at the right vol level. Market makers are not just going to let you run them over, so they will naturally jack up this skew/call IV to a high level where they can win even selling calls and having the stock go up. For example, if Tesla is 490 now and a market maker sold a 600 call and delta hedged it by buying shares, they will win if the stock goes up to 600 even at expiration. The 600 call buyer would actually lose unless he sold earlier. Thus, shares is probably the better play. Nevertheless, the reason for these explosive up moves  is explained by options.

If you are uncomfortable with buying shares due to the high P/E and bubble like nature of Tesla, I can understand that. However, you must also understand investing should be more than a financial statement now. You must factor in things like options volume in terms of investing. Using the same mindset, this is why I would never ever invest in a stock like XOM. No retail is going in and buying XOM calls. This can be said about CSCO too. You don’t get that options pressure you want, which is a “fundamental” reason for a stock to go up. So if you don’t like Tesla since it is indeed a high P/E, you can apply this same idea and buy Apple (or Microsoft) then. It’s a lower and reasonable P/E, has similar call option volume flow, and is a much better long term investment than XOM or CSCO.",t2_7q5wojx4,False,,0,False,Tesla call volume will cause the stock to keep going up - as explained using some options terminology,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik3r8r,False,dark,0.79,,public,58,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,58,,False,,1598899494.0,,[],{},,True,,1598927854.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I come to &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;r/investing&lt;/a&gt; hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it.

,investing,"**Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment**

**Tl;dr FactSet is the most undervalued widespread SaaS/IT solution stock that exists**

If any of you have relevant experience or are friends with people in Investment Banking/other high finance, you know that Factset is the lifeblood of their financial analysis toolkit if and when it’s not Bloomberg, which isn’t even publicly traded. Factset has been around since *1978* and it’s considered a staple like Bloomberg in many wealth management firms, and it offers some of the easiest to access and understandable financial data so many newer firms focused less on trading are switching to Factset because it has a lot of the same data Bloomberg offers for half the cost. When it comes to modern financial data, Factset outcompetes Reuters and arguably Bloomberg as well due to their API services which makes Factset much more preferable for quantitative divisions of banks/hedge funds as API integration with Python/R is the most important factor for vast data lakes of financial data, this suggests Factset will be much more prepared for programming making its way into traditional finance fields. According to Factset, their mission for data delivery is to: “Integrate the data you need with your applications, web portals, and statistical packages. Whether you need [market](https://www.factset.com/products-data/market-data), [company](https://www.factset.com/products-data/core-company-data), or [alternative data](https://www.factset.com/products-data/alternative-data), FactSet flexible data delivery services give you normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our unique symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across your business. Build financial models and power customized applications with FactSet APIs in our [developer portal](https://developer.factset.com/)”. Their technical focus for their data delivery system alone should make it stand out compared to Bloomberg, whose UI is far more outdated and complex on top of not being as technically developed as Factset’s. Factset is the key provider of buy-side portfolio analysis for IBs, Hedge funds, and Private Equity firms, and it’s making its way into non-quantitative hedge funds as well because quantitative portfolio management makes automation of risk management and the application of portfolio theory so much easier, and to top it off, Factset’s scenario analysis and simulation is unique in its class. Factset also is able to automate trades based on individual manager risk tolerance and ML optimization for Forex trading as well. Not only does Factset provide solutions for financial companies, they are branching out to all corporations now and providing quantitative analytics for them in the areas of “corporate development, M&amp;A, strategy, treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations workflows”. Factset will eventually in my opinion reach out to Insurance Risk Management a lot more in the future as that’s a huge industry which has yet to see much automation of risk management yet, and with the field wide open, Factset will be the first to take advantage without a shadow of a doubt. So let’s dig into the company’s financials now:

Their latest 8k filing reported the following:

Revenue increased 2.6%, or $9.6 million, to $374.1 million compared with $364.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher sales of analytics, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions.

Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services was $1.52 billion at May 31, 2020, compared with $1.45 billion at May 31, 2019. The organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency movements, was 5.0%. The primary contributors to this growth rate were higher sales in FactSet's wealth and research workflow solutions and a price increase in the Company's international region

Adjusted operating margin improved to 35.5% compared with 34.0% in the prior year period primarily as a result of reduced employee-related operating expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 11.0% to $2.63 compared with $2.37 for the same period in fiscal 2019.

Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9.2% to $2.86 compared with $2.62 in the prior year period primarily driven by an improvement in operating results.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 15.0% compared with 18.6% a year ago, primarily due to an income tax expense in the prior year related to finalizing the Company's tax returns with no similar event for the three months ended May 31, 2020.

FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.

As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.

It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down

FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.

Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients' own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” ([https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link\_fullReport](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport)), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:

&amp;#x200B;

FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:

&amp;#x200B;

So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing *growth*. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of *32%* between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of *33%*

&amp;#x200B;

EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.

&amp;#x200B;

P/E has declined in the past 2 years, making it a great time to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

Increasing ROE despite lowering of leverage post 2016

&amp;#x200B;

Mountains of cash have been piling up in the coffers increasing chances of increased dividends for shareholders (imo dividend is too low right now, but increasing it will tempt more investors into it), and on top of that in the last 10k a large buyback expansion program was implemented for $210m worth of shares, which shows how confident they are in the company itself.

&amp;#x200B;

SGA expense/Gross profit has been declining despite expansion of offices

I’m a bit concerned about the skin in the game leadership has in this company, since very few executives/board members have significant holdings in the company, but the CEO himself is a FactSet veteran, and knows his way around the company. On top of that, Bloomberg remains king for trading and the fixed income security market, and Reuters beats out FactSet here as well. If FactSet really wants to increase cash flow sources, the expansion into insurance and corp dev has to be successful.

Summary: FactSet has a lot of growth still left in its industry which is already fast-growing in and of itself, and it only has more potential at its current valuation. Earnings September 24th should be a massive beat due to investment banking demand and growth plus Hedge fund requirements for data and portfolio management hasn’t gone anywhere and has likely increased due to more market opportunities to buy-in.",t2_4h8ltwha,False,,0,False,Factset DD,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikndfr,False,dark,0.6,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599006111.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hello fellow investors! I was recently reading about Nestle acquiring a small biotech stock and realized I wasn’t fully aware of the rules of merger situations. I have always loved the idea or merger arbitrage opportunities, but never really go into them. I just wanted to confirm as to how the holders of the targeted company (in this case the biotech company) are compensated in different merger scenarios (like stock for stock, cash buy out, mixed, anything else I don’t know about lol) and vise versa how the company that is making the acquisition is effected.

I was recently reading about Nestle acquiring a small biotech stock and realized I wasn’t fully aware of the rules of merger situations. I have always loved the idea or merger arbitrage opportunities, but never really go into them. I just wanted to confirm as to how the holders of the targeted company (in this case the biotech company) are compensated in different merger scenarios (like stock for stock, cash buy out, mixed, anything else I don’t know about lol) and vise versa how the company that is making the acquisition is effected. I think arbitrage is probably the least taken advantage of opportunities for retail investors and has huge potential to help get those yearly returns above the market without adding risk.

,investing,"  

Today we’re going to talk about float, what it is and how you can build billion-dollar companies with it. Float is the money that a business receives today but doesn’t have to pay out until sometime in the future. Float is most commonly seen in insurance companies with customers paying premiums upfront to insure themselves against bad things happening sometime in the future. More examples include: Video game publishers, where they receive pre-orders. Commercial banking when they receive deposits and so on. 

Why is receiving money upfront so valuable even when it needs to be paid at later date? Well, you can invest it! And the longer you have to invest it, the more likely it will grow larger than the amount that you will have to eventually pay out! So, you can see how easily this can snowball. Say I owned a tiny insurance business that insured $1,000 worth of damages for a year in exchange for a $100 upfront payment. If I have $10,000 in the bank I can safely have say, five customers insured like this every year for $500. Every year I can invest the money I got from those new customers and every year the cash I have grows so I can safely insure more customers and the cash you have grows in an exponential manner. Ok cool got it. So, what does this have to do with Berkshire Hathaway?

Sometime around the mid-1960s Mr. Buffett realized, with the help of his friend Charlie Munger, that he can’t keep investing in broken down businesses and had to instead look for “franchise” business that will continue to compound his hard earned capital through thick and thin. The next thing he realized is that he couldn’t just rely on the free cash flow generated from those company’s and had to instead find low cost financing for his acquisitions. That low cost financing came in the form of an insurance float which, as we’ve seen, are the premiums paid by insurance customers up front in order to be paid out by the insurance company later. Buffett bought a ton of these insurance companies starting with National Indemnity in 1967

Wait, why did we just say that float is low cost financing? Why is it financing and what is the cost of that financing? Well, float is financing because you are receiving money today, but you have to pay it out sometime in the future, exactly like a loan. The beauty of float though is that you don’t have to pay interest on that money! The only “interest” that you have to pay on that money is the normal cost of operating your business.

We’ve already seen why float would matter so much to Buffett, but it bears repeating.  A dollar you receive today is worth more than a dollar you get a week from now because you can invest it at some rate to receive more money in the future. Buffet realized that the more float he had, the more float he could invest to buy other businesses. Float would compound in lockstep with the free-cashflow generated by his other businesses and in time create a juggernaut.

The final step in the Berkshire secret formula was increasing the duration of time between when the premiums are received and when they’re paid out. So, for Buffett, this meant buying up longer tailed insurance companies like insurance for catastrophes, and recently, Reinsurance companies.  And there you have it!

,investing,"Securities fraud class action brought on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired VXRT securities during the Class Period – between June 25, 2020 and July 20, 2020, inclusive. The case seeks to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

Vaxart is a clinical-stage Company purportedly engaged in the discovery and development of vaccines for a variety of diseases that would be administered orally, rather than by injection.

The class action arises from Defendants’ alleged fraudulent scheme to profit from artificially inflating the Company’s stock price by announcing false and misleading information concerning Vaxart’s oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on June 26, 2020, Vaxart issued a press release entitled, “Vaxart’s COVID-19 Vaccine Selected for the U.S. Government’s Operation Warp Speed,” falsely claiming its vaccine had been selected to participate in a non-human challenge study, organized and funded by OWS.  This announcement sent the price of Vaxart shares rocketing higher.

In furtherance of the scheme, Defendants amended controlling shareholder Armistice’s existing warrant agreements, allowing Armistice to exercise all of its warrants immediately and sell 27.6 million Vaxart shares, reaping profits of approximately $200 million.  Defendants also issued millions of dollars in favorable stock options to Vaxart’s most senior executives.

The Complaint alleges that on July 25, 2020, details emerged revealing Defendants’ deception concerning their alleged pump and dump scheme. In particular, on July 25, 2020, The New York Times published an article entitled, “Corporate Insiders Pocket $1 Billion in Rush for Coronavirus Vaccine,” covering suspiciously timed stock bets that had generated significant profits for senior executives and board members at companies developing vaccines and treatments. Vaxart was featured prominently in the article, and it clarified “Vaxart is not among the companies selected to receive significant financial support from Warp Speed.” In response to this news, the price of Vaxart shares dropped sharply lower on July 27, 2020 from $12.29 to $11.16.

Vaxart was featured prominently in the article, and it clarified “Vaxart is not among the companies selected to receive significant financial support from Warp Speed.” In response to this news, the price of Vaxart shares dropped sharply lower on July 27, 2020 from $12.29 to $11.16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving Vaxart misled investors about OWS’s potential funding support for the Company,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m new to investing and before today I had never tried to log into my account when the market has just opened. 

Today though, due to the stock split with Apple, I am trying to log in on both app and desktop and the site is super slow and keeps giving me error messages when I log in.

What seems most obvious is that Vanguard is crashing because everyone is trying to log into their accounts all at once, maybe because of Apple’s stock split.

However I wonder, is this just normal behavior this early when the market is just opening?


UPDATE:

Do not do what I did and hit submit payment 100 times hoping to get a confirmation. It says my account has way more now than I intended and that is even in my checking account.

,investing,"On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players. This follows several other media reports over the last few years (CNBC, WSJ) that AT&amp;T has been considering selling its DirecTV business, as well as comments by DISH management that a combination of Dish's satellite operations with DirecTV are inevitable.

Goldman issued the following report this morning outlining some interesting thoughts:

**Why would AT&amp;T sell DirecTV? Three potential objectives:**

1. **Streamlining AT&amp;T's operations to focus on mobile, broadband and streaming entertainment.** AT&amp;T is the most diversified company in the US communications and media sector. While this diversification has the potential to yield certain competitive advantages, such as AT&amp;T's bundles of wireless and broadband connectivity with its streaming video services such as HBO Max, we believe it has also created a degree of operational complexity. This is especially the case, in our view, for the DirecTV satellite TV service, which is experiencing significant structural headwinds owing to industry-wide cord-cutting that is not only resulting in customer losses, but reducing the appeal of the service in AT&amp;T's product bundles.

With AT&amp;T having already made its flagship HBO Max streaming service available to its DirecTV customers, we believe the company has now captured the majority of the product and cost synergies from this asset. As such AT&amp;T may view that it can be a more focused and nimble competitor in its core mobile, broadband and streaming markets by divesting control of its satellite TV operations in the US. Indeed, separating from AT&amp;T could also allow DirecTV to operate in a structure that works better for a mature cash-generative business, which could benefit AT&amp;T to the extent it retained a stake in the company.

2) **Accelerate AT&amp;T's balance sheet deleveraging.** Since completing the acquisition of Time Warner in 2018, AT&amp;T has reduced it net debt by $25 billion from $177 billion to $152 billion as of 2Q20 through a combination of strong FCF, asset sales and other asset monetizations. While this has lowered its net debt/EBITDA from 3.3x to 2.7x, the company remains well above its historical leverage in the low-2x range, which we believe remains its long-term target. As such, we believe that AT&amp;T could likely consider any transaction that enabled it to accelerate its delevering by pulling forward value for non-core assets. Even if a transaction were only modestly delevering, in terms of its net leverage ratio, we believe that simply lowering the gross dollar amount of outstanding debt could improve AT&amp;T's financial flexibility by making it less reliant on the investment grade credit markets during a period of significant economic uncertainty.

3) **Achieve further cost efficiencies and synergies.** This opportunity would likely only apply to a combination with another pay-TV operator (vs. a financial buyer) owing to significant overlapping costs. We have not attempted to estimate synergies from this type of hypothetical combination, but AT&amp;T's own combination of DirecTV with its U-verse business in 2015 could be a potential precedent.

That merger represented the combination of DirecTV's base of 20 million US satellite TV subscribers with AT&amp;T's base of 6 million landline U-verse video subscribers. While these services were based on different infrastructure, the company initially estimated cost synergies would exceed $1.6 billion on an annual run rate basis by year-three after closing. One year later, AT&amp;T increased this target to $2.5 billion, based on lower programming costs across the combined video operations (DirecTV + U-verse) with other savings from core operational functions (e.g., truck rolls, billing, customer care, advertising, etc.).

**A combination with Dish could face regulatory scrutiny.**

For details on the potential regulatory considerations facing a potential merger of DirecTV and Dish, please see takeaways from our discussion with Andrew Lipman, partner at law firm Morgan Lewis, at the 28th Annual Communacopia conference in 2019. Here is our summary of Mr. Lipman's comments, which you can find in the report cited above:

Mr. Lipman believes that Dish and DirecTV could potentially get a deal through federal regulatory authorities if there was a will from both companies to merge. This is despite the failure of a similar proposal to merge between the two satellite operators in 2002. He believes that the pay-TV market has changed drastically since the original merger attempt (i.e. fiber and cable presence in rural areas, OTT offerings). Mr. Lipman believes that such a deal could potentially be structured in different ways to address the government's likely concerns that rural areas could be hurt by this merger including 1) price freezes or 2) allowing the two companies to combine back office functions, prior to a potential full merger.

**What impact would a sale of DirecTV have on the pay-TV market?**

We do not believe that a partial sale of DirecTV to financial partners, or any entity which would continue to operate DirecTV as an independent satellite TV operator, would have a material impact on the pay-TV market. This is because such a hypothetical transaction would not significantly impact the number of competitors. To some extent, it could yield a modest increase in competition as DirecTV would now compete directly with AT&amp;T's other pay-TV services, including its new Internet-based service AT&amp;T TV. However, we do not see this as a material change in the overall competitive backdrop.

A theoretical combination of DirecTV with Dish would represent a merger of the 2nd (DirecTV) and 4th (Dish) largest pay-TV providers in the US, resulting in a new company with over 25 million video customers (as of 2019), ranking it ahead of the current #1 Comcast (21.2 million). As such, a merger of the US's two satellite TV operators could lower competition among traditional facilities-based pay-TV providers. However, as we detailed in our recent initiation report on the US media sector, traditional pay-TV services are already experiencing material subscriber losses owing to competition from new streaming services. The pressures on satellite TV providers have been particularly intense, with the combined customer bases of DirecTV and Dish declining by 13% in 2019 vs. video subscriber declines of approximately 3% for the major cable providers. As such, a theoretical combination of these companies could potentially enable them to generate synergies that position them to remain viable competitors in the pay-TV sector longer than if they remained independent.

**What is DirecTV's financial contribution to AT&amp;T**

AT&amp;T does not report any financial or operating metrics for its DirecTV satellite TV operations. This business is included within the company's Entertainment Group segment, which in 2019 generated $45 billion of revenue (25% of consolidated revenue) and $10 billion in EBITDA (17% of consolidated EBITDA). Below, we provide our rough estimates for the size of the DirecTV subscriber base and its contributions to AT&amp;T's revenue and EBITDA in 2019. These estimates are intended to be illustrative in order to provide context for the scale of DirecTV within AT&amp;T's consolidated operations and relative to peers in the pay-TV sector.

**We estimate that AT&amp;T ended 2019 with approximately 16 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers**, out of 19.5 million total Premium TV subscribers. As of YE2018, when AT&amp;T last disclosed the mix of it Premium TV subscriber base, the company had 19.2 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers and 3.7 million U-verse video subscribers. In 2019, the company's combined Premium TV subscriber base declined 15%, which we believe was primarily driven by losses of DirecTV customers owing to the end of promotional pricing. For context, the large cable operators, whose video + broadband service bundles are more comparable to the U-verse offerings, saw their video subscriber bases decline by approximately 3% in 2019. If we assume the same trend played-out with U-verse, then that implies the DirecTV subscriber base declined 17% in 2019.

For context, this implies that DirecTV ended 2019 roughly tied with Charter (16.1 million video subscribers) as the second largest pay-TV service in the US. This compares to Comcast's video subscriber base of 21.2 million and Dish's satellite TV subscriber base of 9.4 million.

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $25 billion of revenue in 2019**. We arrive at this estimate by assuming that ARPU for DirecTV subscribers is comparable to AT&amp;T's reported Premium TV ARPU in 2019 of $121. This implies that in 2019 the DirecTV satellite TV service contributed 57% of Entertainment Group revenue (14% of consolidated).

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $7 billion of EBITDA in 2019**. This estimate implies an EBITDA margin in the mid/high 20%s. We believe this is a reasonable rough estimate based on few factors. First, DirecTV's closest peer, Dish, operates with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. Based on AT&amp;T's scale in video vs. Dish, we estimate that its average monthly programming costs per Premium TV subscriber is approximately $5 lower than DISH's. This estimated cost advantage represents approximately 4-percentage points of margin benefit for DirecTV vs. this peer.

Second, we assume additional scale benefits in SG&amp;A. For context, when AT&amp;T acquired DirecTV in 2015, its US satellite TV operations generated an EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. While we estimate that the DirecTV subscriber base in the US has declined by over 20% since the acquisition, we also estimate that AT&amp;T has increased the service's ARPU by over 10% and generated cost synergies, which management previously estimated would reach a run-rate of $2.5 billion. We therefore believe it is reasonable to estimate that margins have remained at least flat, and likely improved, since the acquisition of DirecTV, despite material subscriber losses.

Our approximate estimate for DirecTV's EBITDA implies that in 2019 it contributed nearly 70% of Entertainment Group EBITDA (12% of consolidated).",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$T - thoughts on the potential sale of DirecTV,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik5l65,False,dark,0.76,,public,17,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,17,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598933533.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players.

 With the work from home model becoming increasingly engrained in every day life, it's no wonder more people are putting in efforts to better their living conditions. Sales from home improvement retail stores like Home Depot surged in the spring, and continue to level off near term. With these tail winds comes a respective demand for homes. Home sales were up 15.5% (YoY) in July as mortgage rates continue to parallel the ""low interest rate"" environment, sliding below 3%. Re-financing was a viable option for many, and will continue to be an outlet for people to free up cash flow.  


 **The 10YR Treasury (TNX)**  has broken out in the last few days, topping .75, the highest since mid-June. A weak dollar and political unrest impacting our next stimulus could cause the 10YR note to rise to the .8 level, where if it breaks out, the market will prohibit multiple expansion. As market makers continue to buy the underlying assets on calls, numbers show that 75% of the volume is for contracts expiring in the next two weeks.   


**Limbach Holdings (LMB)** has bounced over 250% from its March low of $2.37, attracting more and more retail investors.

**Goldman (Neutral rating, $295 price target) comments on today's announcement of $5bn equity raise:**

""We believe key points to help contextualize this news includes:

1) $5 bn of equity issuance would represent about 1% incremental shares based on the 8/31/2020 close.

2) The prospectus states that the use of proceeds would be to further strengthen the balance sheet, and for general corporate purposes.

3) Tesla has a history of issuing equity, but unlike this proposed offering Tesla has typically announced offerings on the day it filed or within a few weeks of filing its 10-Q/10-K. Further, while the company commented on its 4Q19 EPS call that it was not capital constrained, investing as fast as it sensibly could and generating positive cash flow, Tesla has also raised capital post making those comments (the company last issued new equity in February 2020). Finally, the company has capacity expansion plans underway at several factories, and per its last 10-K Tesla expects average annual capex to be $2.5-$3.5 bn from 2020-2022.

We therefore consider the news to be somewhat of a surprise especially related to the timing, but not a shock given Tesla's history of equity raises and its future expansion plans.""",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$TSLA - analysts continues to hate it...but have been wrong on the stock thus far,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikq5ba,False,dark,0.33,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599014575.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RBC (Underperform rating, $290 price target)&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;quot;...with many more Teslas in operation, the company’s quality and service, which we believe to be below average, must improve else risking the brand – especially with more competition coming.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;we struggle to explain the run-up to the stock split which academically doesn’t change the value of Tesla equity but could help fuel retail investor interest.

,investing,"I've seen lots of conflicting answers to the question ""I want to put $ in stocks for [x] years.""  Most agree that buying stocks for a shorter horizon than 5 years (for house down payment, etc.) is a bad idea.  Beyond that though, you see some people saying 7, 10, or 15 years is safe.

I'm not going to say I know for sure what is optimal, but what I can do is provide some actual numbers.  While past returns are no guarantee of future returns, on a large enough timescale we can at least build a decent model.  I looked at the past **90 years of total returns** for the S&amp;P 500 (including dividends), Baa corporate bonds, US T-bonds, and 3-month T-bills.

I calculated rolling total return for various holding periods across the entire range.  I then compared them to each other to see how often the stocks had a negative return, and how often they were outperformed by the various bond classes.

[Here are the results.](https://i.imgur.com/YGHcOi1.png)

While I wouldn't draw any **strong** conclusions from this, it certainly casts a lot of doubt on people advising that 7 or 10 years is adequate for 100% equity when you have about a 27-34% chance of losing to bonds.  On the other end of the spectrum, this paints many target date funds as overly conservative, for example the [Vanguard 2045 fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtivx) holds about 10% bonds even though they have about half that chance of beating stocks.

I expect these numbers may be quite surprising to some people, especially since the past decade has been a generous bull market that makes equities look invincible.  Anyway, if anybody has other quantitative means of looking at this, please share.  Happy investing!

,investing,"Seeing the recent rapid rise of the market and some stock went skyrocketed, I am curious about what would the academia think on the phenomenon, So I looked for research papers that were published on journals and would like to share this particular paper on 'bubble' with you all.

The paper [bubble for fama](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v131y2019i1p20-43.html) is written by Greenwood, Robin, Shleifer, Andrei and You, Yang and was published in the Journal of Financial Economics, one of the most eminent financial journal. They aimed to evaluate the saying from Eugene Fama, 2013 Nobel laureate in economic sciences. Who once said in 2016 ""For bubbles, I want a systematic way of identifying them. It’s a simple proposition. You have to be able to predict that there is some end to it. All the tests people have done trying to do that don’t work. Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles.""  Here are what the authors of the paper have done.

First of all, they put their focus on industries instead of individual stocks. A major reason for this is bubbles, by nature is very hard to define, using industry as a unit ensure the same phenomenon is experienced by the same enough firms. (Imagine a penny stock that can go up by 100% then drop in an hour, is it very hard to define if it is a bubble for statistical analysis). Researchers defined an industry is experiencing a 'price runs up' if the return for the past 2 years is over 100%, and define a bubble burst to be over 40% drops in the following 2 years after the peak. 

Using data from 1928 to 2014. Researchers have identified 40 'runs up' in the US stock market. And they realise the Eugene Fama is mostly right in the sense that you couldn't tell if a price run-up will be followed by a burst of not. In the 40 episodes, 21 of them experienced an over 40% crash while the other 19 episodes didn't. So you cannot say something is in a bubble just because their price has gone up by a lot. And the average time needed for the bubble episodes to reach the peaks varies from 0 months to 17 months. So it would be against the stat if you were to short sell a rapid raising industry, not only you would be proven wrong about half the time, you also need to have extreme deep pocket combined with a lot of patients to win the battle. For episodes that indeed crashed, on average they will return to the market level, and generally speaking, the market is always rising given long enough time. The implication here is even if you buy in a bubble industry, you might still retain some gains after the bubble burst (most likely to be beaten by the market tho).

However, there's more to come. The researchers further study who's the differences between the crashing episodes and the non-crashing episodes. They found that there are some characteristics that distinguish crashing and non-crashing, all with p-value &lt; 10% (That is they have 1/10 chances their statistical significance is happened by chance). They are: 

1. 1-year change in volatility (Volatility from year T-1 to now, minus volatility from year T-2 to year T-1). On average the volatility change is positive for crashed episodes and slightly negative for non-crash episodes.
2. firm age. Crashed episodes are on average 15 percentile rank younger than non-crashed episodes.
3. age tilt (to capture whether the price run-up occurred disproportionately among the younger firms in the industry). Crashed episodes' price run-up has a higher concentration in younger firms.
4. Percentage of Issuers ( percentage of firms in the industry which issued new shares within the last two years) Crashed episodes have a higher percentage of issuers.
5. Acceleration (Difference between 2 years return to (year T-2 to year T-1 return) Crashed episodes have a higher acceleration. Around 30% higher in fact.

Then the researchers asked, can these characteristics predict the coming 2 years return for the 40 episodes identified? The answer is yes and no. After going through some statistic measure and control for market return. None of these characteristics can predict future returns with satisfactory statistical power. However, if we don't control for market return, all of the above can predict a lower return within the coming 24 months. And on the [online appendix](http://docplayer.net/136929952-Internet-appendix-with-supplement-results-for-bubbles-for-fama-robin-greenwood-andrei-shleifer-and-yang-you-last-updated-sep.html) , they also show using these characteristics as signal to avoid bubble can boost the return to 10% more compared with the benchmark index.

Although the paper's focus is on the industry level, but I believe the discovery is linked with strong behavioural/economics explanation and is applicable to individual stocks. One thing I forgot to mention above is that almost all the bubbles happened in a bull market. Reading this paper reminds me of today's market. I am still a student and relatively new to the investing world. English isn't my first language so apologies if there are places that isn't clear enough. Thanks for reading.

Pros
Dominant position in the industry
Brand loyalty and established business


Cons
Have been making losses before 2020
Limited room for growth beyond the position they are in

,investing,"  

Sitting atop a cash pile of over $100 billion dollars, Warren Buffet is often asked why Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend. The standard answer for the past thirty or forty years has been that Berkshire’s cash pile would be better spent on either acquisitions or share buybacks. While there is certainly truth to this statement, there is a bigger reason for the lack of a Berkshire yield.

Warren Buffett personally owns approximately 250,000 shares of Class A Berkshire stock. Often Buffett has been quoted as saying he has “never sold a share of Berkshire Hathaway.” If this is true, that would indicate that in the process of building up his multi-billion-dollar fortune, Buffett has never paid any income taxes on his Berkshire shares. Assuming Buffett does not, or has not, ever personally sold any Berkshire shares, that would mean he is not only a savvy investor but also the undisputed master of the unrealized gain. 

Warren has often said he draws a yearly salary of $100,000 from Berkshire Hathaway. Assuming his Berkshire salary is accurate and he has little else for additional income coming in, it is likely that Buffett (a multi-billionaire) pays nearly the same amount of income taxes as you or I. A Berkshire dividend would be exceptionally detrimental to Buffett’s income tax bill. A quick calculation to demonstrate:

(all numbers very approximate for demonstration purposes)

Number of “A” shares owned by Buffett: 250,000

A 5% yield on Berkshire “A” shares for 1 year would yield (for Buffett) approximately: $4,087,500,000

A 20% capital gain tax on his dividend would result in a personal tax bill of approximately: $817,500,000

With Berkshire paying a 5% yield, not only would Buffett end up with a near $1 billion tax bill, he would also have to find a place to invest nearly $3 billion of his after-tax dividend income (every year). This clearly demonstrates why he prefers share buybacks over dividend payouts.

Buffett is a multi-billionaire and he certainly did not get there by accident. As a result of (arguably) the greatest (legal) tax avoidance scheme in the history of modern American business, Buffett has painted himself into a corner when it comes to the payment of a Berkshire dividend. Berkshire investors can pretty near be guaranteed Berkshire Hathaway will never pay a divided as long as Buffett is alive and holding his shares. We will, however, very likely see a Berkshire yield upon Buffett’s exit from the business world.",t2_7wttkosz,False,,0,False,The Real Reason Berkshire Hathaway does not Pay a Dividend.,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ijj5di,False,dark,0.87,,public,216,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,216,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598845720.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting atop a cash pile of over $100 billion dollars, Warren Buffet is often asked why Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend.

I'll offer my prediction in exchange for yours.  I have no tacit data to support my thinking but here it is.  FAANG will get a correction somewhere along the line.  Not a crash.  Maybe a 10-15% drop from ATH.  That correction will stop this bull run and with everyone declaring tech as 'oversold' FAANG et all will hang at a stagnant value into perpetuity.   I offer MSFT from 2001 to 2012 as an example.   After the tech-crash of 2001, MSFT was 'stuck' at $35 for over 10 years.   10 years of steady improvements in customer base, product diversity, and increasing revenues but investors couldn't seem to care.  


Retail investors (who all suffer from ADD) will flock to other sectors while waiting for the next tech-bull-run to start.

,investing,"So I know that bonds decrease in value when interest rates rise (because you could get higher returns on newly issued bonds). But isn't this ""decrease in bond value"" only relative to the second market? I.e, this ""decreased bond value"" is only important in the context of other investors wanting to buy/sell bonds to one another?

So if you have a bond with 2% interest rate yield, but the interest rates are now 3%, obviously you aren't getting the maximum possible return, but as your interest rate returns are still the same, regardless of how the second market values your lower interest bond, you're still getting a profit-- albeit it just being less than the maximum possible, correct?

So my question is, is the decreasing value of your bond in the secondary market when interest rates increase only significant if you're looking to make the most profit/buy the most profitable type of bond available?

Simplifying the picture, is it safe to assume one is ""greedy"" (simplifying desires for greater profit margins) for worrying about increased interest rates and thus the (declining) value of the associated bond, as in the end you still get back your bond equity + original 2% interest rate?

Also, if the interest rate is increasing, for the long term, doesn't that mean inflation will (at the very least) slow down? Thus I'm assuming you're still getting profit/value out of your bond (albeit the return being less than the new 3% bond--but you're still making profit).",t2_5fw9anv1,False,,0,False,Bonds and rising interest rates,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ijfhwo,False,dark,0.79,,public,31,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,31,,False,,1598805086.0,,[],{},,True,,1598833698.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I know that bonds decrease in value when interest rates rise (because you could get higher returns on newly issued bonds). But isn&amp;#39;t this &amp;quot;decrease in bond value&amp;quot; only relative to the second market? I.e, this &amp;quot;decreased bond value&amp;quot; is only important in the context of other investors wanting to buy/sell bonds to one another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have a bond with 2% interest rate yield, but the interest rates are now 3%, obviously you aren&amp;#39;t getting the maximum possible return, but as your interest rate returns are still the same, regardless of how the second market values your lower interest bond, you&amp;#39;re still getting a profit-- albeit it just being less than the maximum possible, correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, is the decreasing value of your bond in the secondary market when interest rates increase only significant if you&amp;#39;re looking to make the most profit/buy the most profitable type of bond available?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplifying the picture, is it safe to assume one is &amp;quot;greedy&amp;quot; (simplifying desires for greater profit margins) for worrying about increased interest rates and thus the (declining) value of the associated bond, as in the end you still get back your bond equity + original 2% interest rate?&lt;/p&gt;

My understanding is that ETFs are generally considered to be more tax-efficient and the better choice, but most articles that say this are saying so in comparison to actively managed mutual funds.

However, if an index fund is *passively* managed (ex.

I know that the expense ratios differ, but as someone who finds tax filings to be very confusing, my main concern is dealing with the tax implications of these choices.

If it were up to me, I would prefer to invest in an index fund like FXAIX in my taxable account so that I don't have to purchase whole shares of SPY, but if SPY triggers less capital gains then I'd obviously prefer to go with that.

Since the price tanked, they decided to make a second offering to rise the goal of 1.5 billions... Just months after they secured funding from the chinese goverment for that same amount of dollars.

Many seem to believe the offering is well placed due to the run and because they wanted to increase their ownership from around 70 to 80 something percent.

From a shareholders perspective, this seems to be a very dodgy move. I believe this is more about greed than anything else by the company's management. 70-80% ownership does not have any meaningful value since they already have the majority of the company's ownership.

In any case, we will see how the market reacts (already down 5% in pre market). And as a typical case of dodgy moves by the chinese, I consider this a risky bet at this price range. I am setting a stop-loss at 16.5 level and might reenter the stock at a latter date.

&gt;	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Herbalife Nutrition Ltd will pay $123.1 million to settle criminal and civil charges it bribed Chinese officials in government agencies and media outlets to boost its business in China, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday.

&gt;The multi-level marketing company, whose products include dietary supplements, entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement in which it admitted to conspiring to violate the books and records provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law.

&gt;Authorities said Herbalife schemed from 2007 to 2016 to bribe Chinese officials with cash, entertainment, meals and travel to obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media.

&gt;China accounted for 19% of Herbalife’s $4.49 billion of net sales in 2016, up from 7% in 2006, regulatory filings show.

,investing,"Hello guys and gals,

So i have been a longtime lurker on this sub-reddit since I started my investing journey in early 2018. I wanted to get input on how one would go about pricing a stock that is not traded on any financial market. Rather, the stock is purchased from directly from known buyers. The thing is that you would have to first figure out who owns the stock through an ad or simply asking around.

The company first sold its shares at 10$ a piece in 2004. Fast forward 16 years later, and the same share is supposedly valued at $10. This year the stock paid 1.42 in its annual dividends to shareholders. By this amount, if you had purchased the stock at $10, you would have a 14.2% dividend yield. What I am baffled about is that the company does not know how to value its own stock and often tells its shareholders that the book value of the share is about $28 (2019 financials). People still buy and sell the stock somewhere from 10 - 15$ each. I quickly saw the opportunity and amassed quite an amount of stock from people who had shares and could not value them properly other than from the price they paid (which was at $10 each).

My question is how would you value the stock given the stock performance over the years? Below are some metrics I compiled. Please note that I am not a finance person so I did some calculations pulled from the bank financials since 2009. 

(USD)

**2009:**

Earnings Per Share: 1.28

Dividends: $0.68

Book Value: $17.72

Dividend Payout Ratio: 53.4%

&amp;#x200B;

**2019:**

Assets: 171.5 mil

Stockholder Equity: 26 mil

Net Income: 2.66 mil

Earnings Per Share: $2.85

Dividends: $1.43

Book Value: $27.87

Dividend Payout Ratio: 53.6%

&amp;#x200B;

**10 year average growth rates (2009 - 2019)**

&amp;#x200B;

Average Dividend Growth Rate: 7.64%

Average Book Value Growth Rate: 4.28%

Average EPS Growth Rate: 8.28%

Average ROE: 8.51%

&amp;#x200B;

How much would the stock be valued at given the financials? Not sure if I listed all the pertinent data for stock valuation.

,investing,"So I recently looked at ""Portfolio Visualizer"" and found something called ""Portfolio Optimization"". It gave me the option to see what % of my money I should put into my positions for the max Sharpe ratio.

Tickers: VOO, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, ARKW, ARKG, T, KO  (These are my current holdings in my Roth and I firmly believe in all of them for the long run. Tech is everywhere and not going anywhere anytime soon imo).

If I set all my position to a **min. of 5% each, after around 6 years, I get around $40,000** after an initial investment of $10,000. If I set a **minimum % of 0.01 for each of my positions, so that each position would show up, after around 6 years, I get around $51,000** after an initial investment of $10,000.

When looking at the allocation % for each position for the ""No minimum % weight"", I can see that QQQ and VOO have less than 0.05%. **The highest weight was in MSFT at 43% while ARKW is 2nd at 38%**, then AAPL at 14%. I found this odd since I believed that investing more towards index funds, or ETFs that track NASDAQ or the S&amp;P500, would've been better in the long run.

So, I removed ARKW and ARKG due to their recent inception year of 2014. Then, **I swapped VOO with SPY** since VOO had an inception year of 2010 and they both track the same thing. Now, **I have a 21 year period I can look at**, since QQQ's inception year was 1999.

Trying both methods again, 5% min. weight and 0.01% min. weight, I got around $640,000 and $1,200,000 respectively. **Both are very heavily weighted towards AAPL**, which makes sense since if I bought AAPL shares in 1999, each share would've costed around $1.30 and would've grown to over $15,000 each if AAPL never had stock splits.

But again, if I look at the other position weight %s, **QQQ and SPY had less than 0.6% combined** (and in the 5% portfolio, both are at the minimum of 5%).

**SO, is it wrong for me to think that I should NOT invest more in VOO and QQQ (or similar positions), like I am now and instead, more towards solid companies or ETF's (like ARKW) with a long horizon like Apple and Microsoft or other solid companies after I do my DD on each of them?**

I'd be down a few dollars if I sold them, although I believe their strong dividend is safe.

It&amp;#39;s a major grocery chain, mostly based in the Midwest, which has been around for nearly a century. I&amp;#39;ve been to their Jewel Osco stores and it does seem like a declawed union shop, much like Kroger. Shares are around 14 dollars. Compared to Kroger that seems like a &lt;em&gt;steal.&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m confident they&amp;#39;ll be a decent long term investment and I put them at the top of my buy list. (Once again, thank you fellow Redditor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own shares in Hercules Capital, which invests in software companies--some of which are now known names--but their stock has really been weird in that it underperforms and doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be trending upwards. I&amp;#39;d be down a few dollars if I sold them, although I believe their strong dividend is safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I could wait a bit and buy Albertson&amp;#39;s with my next check, or I could sell Hercules at a loss to buy Albertson&amp;#39;s. I&amp;#39;m generally against selling good companies so I would like to know your opinion on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Economies of scale is the single most important competitive advantage that a company can possess in its market. Economies of scale is achieved when a company can progressively lower its costs as more and more products are produced. Said another way, the more customers you have for a product or service, the more you can spread fixed costs to each customer which lowers the total cost of each product. It follows then that the types of business that most benefit from economies of scale are those that have very high fixed costs as opposed to high variable costs.

So why are economies of scale the most durable competitive advantage available? Imagine you own the only grocery store in town, for years it is profitable, and everyone seems to enjoy going to it. One day a new grocery store opens across the street and begins taking market share. Should you, the owner, panic and sell the store immediately? No of course not. Assuming the new grocery store is not much more efficient and does not have much better selection or technology, your store will always win because you can spread your fixed costs across your large customer base while your competitor cannot. So, if there is a price war you will always win and even before that you will always have lower prices than your competitor.

Ok, what does this have to do with Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway? Amazon’s entire business has been and always will be about scale. I present to you the world’s most famous napkin:

&amp;#x200B;

This is Amazon’s business model in nutshell, drawn in the late 90s by Bezos himself. Note that the inside of this reinforcing loop can be applied to almost any retailer that has ever existed. Amazon’s real special sauce though, is the way that it lowers cost structure by investing in scale and then uses that scale to lower its prices.  Investing in scale means building fulfillment centers, hiring software engineers and doing whatever it takes to own the entire value chain. Crucially, this investment in scale means that it is harder for competitors to replicate Amazon’s value proposition because, as we’ve seen before, investing in high fixed costs businesses mean that you must have enough customers to be able to spread those costs until it reaches a reasonable per unit level. Since Amazon’s second main organization focus is customer service, they are hoping it would be very hard for competitors to get enough eCommerce customers to get those fixed costs down to a competitive level. So, this is the principle behind everything that Amazon does. AWS? Scale. Prime Video? Scale. And so on. You might be wondering, if Amazon keeps entering these extremely high fixed cost businesses, how do they get enough customers to make it work? The answer is Amazon Prime. Amazon is the new grocery store that also gives you everything else in the town for free. So now if you are the owner of the old grocery store in town, you're not just competing with the new store, you're competing with everything else the town has to offer bundled into one. That's how they get around the scale problem and that's how they can keep on entering tough, scale intensive, industries and succeed.",t2_7whqrqof,False,,0,False,Amazon and the Supremacy of Scale,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ij3lia,False,dark,0.65,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,1598748245.0,,[],{},,True,,1598776647.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economies of scale is the single most important competitive advantage that a company can possess in its market.

Why not just sell, wait for it to get down, and just re-buy down there? If it comes back up faster than you expected, just re-buy at where you left off (9K) and there’s no fuss.

,investing,"For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&amp;P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&amp;P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

&gt; OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

&gt;Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&amp;P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",t2_4zbt1,False,,0,False,"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&amp;P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance?",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ii8wsu,False,dark,0.96,,public,1741,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1741,,False,,1598701686.0,,[],{},,True,,1598656651.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&amp;amp;P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with total market funds like Vanguard&amp;#39;s VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like investors using &amp;quot;ex-US&amp;quot; funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are &amp;quot;ex-FAANG&amp;quot; so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks as counterweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Heyy Guys 

First of all im bored since a few months so i startet my intrest in the stock and cryptocurrency market.

Btw im not a native english speaker nor a writer so excuse me if i did some mistakes in my text, i still hope u can read it and get what im tryna tell you 😉

So as some of you may have heard of XRP (Ripple) for the ones who havent, XRP is a low priced cryptocurrency that offers financial institutions the fastest, most reliable option for
sourcing liquidity on demand.
XRP sells at the moment of typing at around 0.27$ per XRP Coin.

For the past few months i recognized something around the price: the price starts mostly round 0.24/0.25$ sometimes even lower and goes up to its limit (wich lays round 0.29-0.30$) at round 15.- 22. of the month and then drops pretty quick and takes another month till its up again.
in my financial situation atm i cant go all in but now i know +/- when it goes up and when its good to buy  so i always wait a month and get paid out (at my investment as i said i usually buy myself round 100XRP and sell them when the price gets up like 4-5cents which means i make a total profit of round 4-5 bucks) as i mentioned before if u have alot of money this is definitely worth it as it repeats itself nearly every month at literally the same time spawn and its good extra money haha

to say it like if i explain it to my lil siter if u invest round 240$ in XRP it gets you at some point if the price is low enough round 1000XRP that means if the Price of the XRP goes up by only 1 cent you make 10$! if you buy urself 10000XRP u get arround 100$ per cent it goes up!

my advise do as i do it Buy and sell and you get at least a free coffe a month😅

When it comes to building a portfolio of SWAN (sleep well at night) stocks for the long term, HSY is a layup. In the world of stock investing, HSY is an ideal stock for beginners and seasoned investors alike because of its relatively simple business model and its ability to generate consistent returns. The business itself is very straightforward. HSY owns some very recognizable brands such as Reese's and KitKat (HSY owns the rights to KitKat in the US). On average they manage to sell more candy than the year before and with it also raise prices at a rate higher than inflation. As the bulk of their profits are earned in the US, their income statements (reported in USD) are an accurate reflection of what they actually earned. Compare that to other excellent companies like CL, KO etc which are a little harder to evaluate as they earn most of their profits overseas and you have to factor in currency fluctuations to get the real picture (their annual reports usually do a good job of it though).  As Peter Lynch said, ""Invest in what you know"" and it's safe to say most Americans have consumed a Hershey's product at some point in their lives. Heck, you can even use the excuse of ""market research""  to buy some Reese's peanut butter cups the next time you go to the store.

I'll try to sum up the key metrics shared in the link above (anyone can view that page even without a subscription)

Over the last 10 years

Net sales growth of \~4% (What's even more impressive is that most of it was achieved with volume increases and pricing power alone. Acquisitions had little to do with it)

EPS growth 8-10%

Div yield 2-3% (The payout ratio stays around 50% which means you also see dividend growth that's 8-10%)

They buy back roughly 1% of outstanding shares each year.

Just like that you get 11-13% CAGR (excluding PE compression/expansion). ROIC consistently in the high teens to 20+ (consumer staples usually average in the mid teens)

Operating margin has increased from 17.4% to 21% (PEP for example was around 15% last year)

To check the quality of the balance sheet, we look at the interest coverage ratio and Net Debt w.r.t Operating Profits. With capital light businesses like HSY, their ability to grow profits/free cash flow is a better indicator of financial strength than shareholder equity.

Interest coverage ratio (Interest expense/EBIT) \~ 10 (A double digit value for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

Net Debt/EBIT \~ 2.5 (Anything less than 3 for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

&amp;#x200B;

**Stock Performance**

HSY has historically fluctuated between a PE of 30 (overpriced) to a PE of 20 (a bargain). Every once in a blue moon the PE dips below 20 and the div yield approaches 3% at which point it becomes a screaming bargain. Barring a total economic collapse or horrendous mismanagement, it's very unlikely you'll see HSY trading at a PE of 15. I would say a PE of 23-25 is a fair price for a wonderful company.

As with any investment, the price you pay affects future returns. To get the real picture of returns generated by HSY, one needs to look at a full business cycle as consumer staples generally tend to outperform during a recession.

[The absolute worst time to buy HSY in the last 15 years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2005&amp;firstMonth=4&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=HSY&amp;allocation1_1=100) would have been in early 2005 when the PE was over 30 and the dividend yield was below 1.5%. A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in April 2005 would result in a present value of $34,863 with a CAGR of 8.49% (underperformed the SPY which returned $37,404 at 8.98%).

[Buying it at its lows](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2008&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=HSY&amp;allocation1_1=100) in early 2008 when the PE was under 20 and the dividend yield was over 3%, A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in January 2008 would result in a present value of $50,619 with a CAGR of 13.76% (outperformed the SPY which returned $28,659 at 8.73%).

Realistically speaking, for an investor who DCAs into this stock, their returns would've been somewhere between 8.5% - 13.8%. HSY is not a stock that you can expect 20%+ CAGR from, but with some luck compounding at 11-12% can build significant wealth (and potentially even outperform SPY).

**Risks**

As far as stocks go, HSY has to be one of the safest investments out there. The company is very conservatively run as the Hershey Trust owns roughly 40% of the company (but over 80% voting rights) and uses the dividends to fund a school for underprivileged children. The dividend is sacrosanct and HSY management is less likely to jeopardize the dividend in search of growth. Consumer staples as a business also face less disruption than other industries. Profits are consistent and the business requires fairly little reinvestment. Candy, alcohol and tobacco are centuries old and consumer tastes change fairly slowly which gives companies plenty of time to adapt. MSFT would go out of business if they were still selling the same OS they made in the 90s. HSY on the other hand is more or less still selling the same candy it was 30-40 years ago. That being said, past performance is no guarantee of future results. So let's address some realistic risks

\- Ruining the quality of the product due to cost cuts in search of short term profits. [Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez did this to the Cadbury Creme Egg](https://theconservativeincomeinvestor.com/why-mondelez-stock-hasnt-gone-up/), which didn't bode well for the stock. A big part of the reason why I'm willing to pay a premium for a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (over some generic brand candy) is because of the taste.  HSY would lose their hard earned market share and goodwill in search of short term gains.

\- Compromising the balance sheet for a bad acquisition. KHC is a good example of this. The 3G method involves slashing costs and levering up the balance sheet to acquire more businesses. Of course, if the acquisition doesn't pan out the stock gets punished accordingly. HSY has tried to build their international presence through acquisitions and it hasn't panned out well so far. Lately they've started diversifying into savory snacks. However, these tend to be pretty small in nature.

\- A sugar tax to combat obesity. I don't think it'll hurt the underlying business too much, but HSY might start trading at a lower earnings multiple.

\- E-commerce might affect HSY a bit. Outside of a few holidays the bulk of candy sales come from impulse purchases a consumer makes at the checkout counter at the store. It usually isn't something a person puts on their shopping list. I think with some proactive management, HSY can get around that by working with vendors to advertise their products while checking out online (much like how pizza joints upsell soda/breadsticks etc at checkout time).

**Conclusion**

If you've made it this far, I thank you for reading this post. I mostly wrote this for people who might be looking into buying individual stocks. I think HSY is an excellent stock for those looking for an above average dividend yield and dividend growth. Buffet often speaks fondly of his See's Candies investment. Much like his own investment, with some luck HSY's dividends alone can pay you back your initial investment and then some over an investing lifetime. As always, sticking with a low cost index fund is a sound strategy. Even a stock like HSY requires a few hours of work each year.

I know you&amp;#39;ll never be able to time the top and bottom perfectly but it&amp;#39;s still possible to save yourself some money and god forbid, even make some money, but I know it&amp;#39;s more often than not, short term trading is stressful and risky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a relatively modest portfolio of a few ETFs and a few stocks with one broker so I know I can make an exit from all my positions relatively painlessly but I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the right strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Folks - would appreciate your input here.   
**Context** \- I'm married, my spouse is reluctant to take any risk. We have $20k in our regular bank account with monthly net income around $7k. We both are public educators contribute to public retirement scheme. I, additionally, have a Roth and a Traditional IRA with monies allocated largely to VFIAX and VIGAX.

**Suggestion** \- I would like my spouse to release $10k of our savings to invest in a variety of Vanguard Bond ETFs. For various different reasons, not least risk-aversion, I do not feel I can get us investing this in VOO ETF or VTI ETF. I am somewhat frustrated at the lack of returns on our $20k in the credit union. My move is to have us put $10k in a combination of BND, VMBS, VTEB\* etc. over the next twelve months and hopefully begin to use the returns of Bond ETFs as encouragement to move to riskier investments with our shared savings. The thought being if we have Bond ETFs in a regular investment account she can always tell me to ""get rid"" if she doesn't like the performance.

1. Which Vanguard Bond ETFs do you like for this strategy of mine?

If I have done my DD seriously and am convinced that it would go up long term, imo CFD is better than LEAP because of no theta decay. InteractiveBroker is not market maker as a CFD trading platform. It just makes money by charging commission and margin rate(&lt;2%) so we don't have to worry that we are fighting against brokers. What's more, because it can leverage 5x at most, I wouldn't be wiped out even if the stock drop 20% (assume the leverage is 2.5x) or 30% (assume the leverage is 2x). While the margin loan only accept 2x leverage at most, investors are usually forced to sell even if they actually don't mind to keep hold or you can only leverage like 1.2\~1.5x. There is also CFD for SPY,VOO, which is better than ES future because there is no expiry date.

TLDR: I think CFD is much better tool if leverage is below 2.5x.

,investing,"Let's get this straight: the price of a stock is not random\*. The price is (theoretically) all future earnings of a company discounted at some rate (depending on the risk of the stock) to the present day. What this means is that in order for you to rationally price a stock, you first want to see what money it will deliver to you in the future, and how likely it is to deliver that money. The more earnings and/or the more likely it is to achieve those earnings, the higher the price. So, to price a stock, you form your expectations about all future earnings and discount them depending on the risk of the stock to today's money, and now you can rationally decide if a stock is a buy or sell or even short. This whole thing is called the Discounted Cash Flow Model.

Now, this is the essence of this post: a change in expectations about future earnings, or a change in the discount rate are the only things that change investor sentiment about a stock. It is not how it has historically performed nor about its current situation. It is always how do investors feel about the future of the company.

A lot of people on this sub like that point out the history of a stock to jusifity going long, or the fact that the company is projected to make a lot of money or that it currently does. The reality is that all of that is reflected in the price of the stock. You can use historical earnings to project future earnings, but that is all, and those future earnings are already reflected in the stock's price. Only a change in expectations or the risk of a company meeting expectations influence the price of the stock. This ultimately means only future events can change the price of the stock, and unless you can predict the future, for all intents and purposes, the price of a stock today is right.

Here's a consequence of this line of thinking:

You want to know why Apple is $2.1T in market cap? It is a mix of high earnings in the future and a very low risk of missing.

Have low risk necessarily means having lower future returns. Almost all (&gt;97%) returns are explained by taking on more risk (using the Fama-French 5 factor model). This is the fundamental idea behind investing, and is basically a law at this point. High risk = high reward.

Apple being priced high means that it's expectations are high (meaning for anyone who invests in Apple right now, they are expecting Apple to earn lots of money) and those expectations are not terribly risky. This ultimately means that for Apple investors to make returns at or above the market, Apple has to consistently beat expectations and become even a safer investment in order for current investors to make returns.

What this ultimately means is that in the long-term, large cap growth stocks are not the best investments you should have. Companies like Apple are basically guaranteeing you low returns in the long run. If you have a long time horizon, you should be investing in systematically risky assets because in the long run, you make more returns. Things like value, and small cap stocks are higher risk and higher reward.

,investing,"Hey people, I see a lot of talk on investment websites about buying  stocks, bonds, gold, crypto, foreign currency, art, collectables, real  estate... etc

This is all fine, but this type of investment has some downsides, at least for me personally:

\-  it's pretty much passive... you just buy stocks, or whatever and wait,  you do nothing with it, you just expect passive income from it

\-  you have no control over what you bought (with the exception of real-estate perhaps), even if you own a few stocks of, say, Coca-Cola  you have no say regarding its management etc... even if you own gold  bars... you can do nothing with them except sell them at appropriate  time

\- I am not really sure if these are even real investments at all, as they hardly create new value, at least  not directly... when you buy stock it just changes owner, nothing  physical happens in the world as a result of your investment (I know it might indirectly benefit the company whose stocks you buy, but it's  still not that you're directly creating any value)

\-  The return is quite predictable-  the higher the  risk, the higher potential return, but there are very few possibilities  to earn a lot, with low risk. Return of investment is generally low, unless there's a lot of risk involved.

**So  there's another type of investment that fascinates me much more, but I  see very little talk about it on the Internet: investing in machinery,  means of production, capital goods, etc...**

I am wondering  why it is so rarely mentioned on websites about investment. What branch  of economics deal with these types of investments? Where to study it?

I think this type of investment is much more interesting for the following reasons:

\-  when you buy a machine or build a factory and put it to use, you're  directly contributing to the economic growth, you're directly creating  new value

\- there is **way more potential**  to profit because **the value of factories, capital goods, etc... is not  the same for everyone and it's not necessarily related to their price**.  Whoever buys a stock can expect exactly the same return from that stock.  But if a doctor who is the owner of a private clinic buys a gastroscope  and knows how to perform gastroscopy or has employees who know,  he can expect huge return of the  investment from such a purchase while that same piece of equipment would  be pretty much worthless to me, as I am not a doctor and I don't own a clinic.

Or another example: for a  multinational brewing company, the value of a regional brewery is much  higher than for some other random company or individual, because that  company has its brand name, know how, developed marketing network, and  upon acquiring a regional brewery it can make much higher profit from  it, than some other company without the experience in brewing  business would ever be able to make.

\- with these  investments you have much more control over what you bought and the  return of investment does not depend only on the value of the equipment  bought, but also on your skill to put it to use...

I am wondering why these types of investments are neglected? If investment was all about buying stocks and other financial assets, the economy would collapse... all the companies would be like Berkshire Hathaway...

&lt;p&gt;Since the plot is somewhat full, I made it interactive so one can show for example only Reddit sentiment and zoom in and out of datapoints. This is in html, but Im not sure whether its allowed to share the link here so in case one is interested to play around with it shoot me a pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/yUI2c0N""&gt;https://imgur.com/yUI2c0N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On request,  interactive html is on:  &lt;a href=""http://www.alternative-analytics.eu/dashboard/sentiment.html""&gt;http://www.alternative-analytics.eu/dashboard/sentiment.html&lt;/a&gt;  (just a plain clean html, no ads, links etc, base url also is not a general website), I update the graph daily.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I am currently 18 years old with a ROTH IRA opened and an individual taxable account.  In my ROTH, I hold VTI, VXUS, and BND. In my taxable, I hold VUG and VXUS. Both are growth plays, and when I graduate with a job that offers a 401k I plan to invest in VOO.  I know the goal is to grow the accounts large enough where you can pull out 4% per year, so does this mean I just never sell the stocks/funds? Also, would that mean, my primary goal for the 3 accounts to have them at $ 1 mil + or do people just calculate their portfolios as the whole amount?

I know the goal is to grow the accounts large enough where you can pull out 4% per year, so does this mean I just never sell the stocks/funds?

,investing,"This Post intends to give an overview over the ticker RLFTF, it is divided in different sections to give a holistic overview over RLFTF. RLFTF is a Drug Development Company registered at the Swiss Stock Exchange RLF.SW and US OTC Ticker RLFTF.

RLFTF's patented drug RLF-100^(TM)(Aviptadil/VIP) has a FDA Fast Track designation and is in two Clinical Trials and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program. Preliminary data show a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most critical COVID-19 ICU Patients.^(3)

**Clinical Data and Mechanism of Action - why this is the best COVID-19 drug.**

RLF-100(Aviptadil/VIP) has a 30 year research history and is already Approved by some Countries for other Indications (UK Approved for Errectile Dysfunction and EU Orphan drug status for Sarcoidosis treatment \*EU designation (EU/3/07/473)), it is already known to be a safe drug with minimal side-effects. ^(5,6)

*Mechanism Of Action*

1. RLF-100 inhibits the SARS-COV-2(COVID19) Virus from replicating itself by blocking the      respective receptors. **It is the only known Drug** so far that **prevents      the Virus from replicating**(spreading), it act's preventive and not just symptomatic. ^(1)
2. RLF-100 prevents and/or stops the Cytokine Storm, is highly anti-inflamantory and acts on RANTES (CCL5) - in almost the same way that e.g. CYDY's LL drug does.^(2)
3. RLF-100 is a natural peptide produced and used by the body to protect &amp; heal the lung and to      improve blood oxygenation. Severe CASES of COVID-19 have shown low levels of exactly this Peptide.^(3)

*Clinical Data*

Currently there are 2 Clinical Trials underway and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program.

1. Phase 2/3 Trial, IV RLF-100 for Critical COVID-19 Patients, Estimated completion in September 2020 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697)
2. FDA granted IND for Clinical Trial of RLF-100 in inhaled version with the goal to provide a **preventive treatment at home** to prevent a moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.^(4) Estimated      completion in November [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096)
3. FDA Intermediate Population Expanded Access of RLF-100, Expanded Access Program for cases too critical to be part of the above studies. In this EAP aims to treat the most critical COVID-19 Patient. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839)

All currently available Clinical Data regarding COVID-19 is from the Expanded Access. The first 21 Patients showed a Rapid recovery and a mortality reduction of over 90%. This patients consist out of the worst case COVID-19 cases like patients with combined double lung transplant rejection and severe COVID-19 infections. ^(3)

*Summary:*

RLF-100 blocks the COVID-19 Virus, prevents a cytokine storm, heals the lungs and improves blood oxygenation with a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most severe cases.

*Further possible indications*

Possible further indications for RLF-100 are almost all lung affecting diseases, as RLF-100 protects and heals the lungs.

Further RLF-100 acts on RANTES(CCL5) and could be indicated for treatment of HIV, Cancer and other RANTES specific diseases after further studies.

**Current Demand / Demand for Expanded Access**

\- On behalf of Relief Therapeutics, NeuroRX is currently fielding multiple requests from representatives of health ministries, who would like to access RLF-100 for their countries. ^(7)

\- There is currently a high volume of requests for Expanded Access from US licensed physicians ^(8)

**FDA Fast Track &amp; NeuroRX Partnership**

RLFTF has a FDA Fast Track designation for the RLF-100 Drug^(1) all clinical trials and studies are conducted by Relief Therapeutics partner NeuroRX, a privately held US Company. Relief Therapeutics own all rights on RLF-100 and pays NeuroRX to conduct the trials. ^(6)

**Share Price Target**

While it is difficult to determine a Share Price for a Stock which this Potential, my personal calculations put the potential between 5-20$. Analysis see the intermediate Share Price target at 18$ which would be a 3600% increase of the current Price.^(9)

**Catalysts in the near Future**

In the Upcoming Days we expect an announcement of a Partnership with a large drug distribution and logistics Company. ^(10)

1. A Board member of RLFTF saidduring an interview that by October they will be ready to deliver      treatment to 100'000 patients. ^(10)
2. Study Results of the Phase 2/3 Study are due in September. Judged by the Expanded Access data, which treats more severe Cases than in the Study, the results are expected to be very good. ^(10)
3. It is expected that the Data      Monitoring Committee might Stop the study and recommend an approval to the FDA, so that Patients from the Placebo control group can be treated as well.^(10)

**Stock Exchange, Markets and Regulatory Specifics**

RLFTF is registered as RLF.SW at the Swiss Stock Exchange and is subject to swiss exchange law's and regulations. All Management Transactions and Transactions of Significant Shareholders have to be Published according to the Swiss Exchange Regulations.

Publishing of (Corporate) News is only allowed off Market (at least 90 minutes prior to Market opening) if News is published during the Market hours, trading will be suspended for some time. There is little chance with this stock for a late ""jump-on"" once a big catalyst is released, as it will be off-market.

In the US RLFTF is a OTC Traded Stock. RLFTF just filed a OTCQB Application and will therefor also be regulated by the SEC in the future, though i feel the Swiss Regulation is stricter anyway.

**Information about Market Cap, Outstanding Shares and Expected Earnings.**

There was a very comprehensive interview by a Swiss Investment Newspaper covering the Above topics, please check out [https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478](https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478) , it contains almost everything we want to know at this Point.

**Disclaimer**

I follow the clinical development of RLF-100 since the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 and i'm invested since early spring, i see myself as a long term investor. My primary investment motivation is that, after extensive reasearch over months, i believe in the potential of this drug. Please do your own due diligence prior to investment and let me know if you would like to have more information included in this Post, i'll try to update it accordingly.

&lt;p&gt;RLF-100(Aviptadil/VIP) has a 30 year research history and is already Approved by some Countries for other Indications (UK Approved for Errectile Dysfunction and EU Orphan drug status for Sarcoidosis treatment *EU designation (EU/3/07/473)), it is already known to be a safe drug with minimal side-effects. &lt;sup&gt;5,6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mechanism Of Action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLF-100 inhibits the SARS-COV-2(COVID19) Virus from replicating itself by blocking the      respective receptors. &lt;strong&gt;It is the only known Drug&lt;/strong&gt; so far that &lt;strong&gt;prevents      the Virus from replicating&lt;/strong&gt;(spreading), it act&amp;#39;s preventive and not just symptomatic. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLF-100 prevents and/or stops the Cytokine Storm, is highly anti-inflamantory and acts on RANTES (CCL5) - in almost the same way that e.g. CYDY&amp;#39;s LL drug does.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLF-100 is a natural peptide produced and used by the body to protect &amp;amp; heal the lung and to      improve blood oxygenation. Severe CASES of COVID-19 have shown low levels of exactly this Peptide.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are 2 Clinical Trials underway and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 2/3 Trial, IV RLF-100 for Critical COVID-19 Patients, Estimated completion in September 2020 &lt;a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697""&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDA granted IND for Clinical Trial of RLF-100 in inhaled version with the goal to provide a &lt;strong&gt;preventive treatment at home&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent a moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Estimated      completion in November &lt;a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096""&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDA Intermediate Population Expanded Access of RLF-100, Expanded Access Program for cases too critical to be part of the above studies. In this EAP aims to treat the most critical COVID-19 Patient. &lt;a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839""&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All currently available Clinical Data regarding COVID-19 is from the Expanded Access. The first 21 Patients showed a Rapid recovery and a mortality reduction of over 90%. This patients consist out of the worst case COVID-19 cases like patients with combined double lung transplant rejection and severe COVID-19 infections. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLF-100 blocks the COVID-19 Virus, prevents a cytokine storm, heals the lungs and improves blood oxygenation with a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further possible indications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible further indications for RLF-100 are almost all lung affecting diseases, as RLF-100 protects and heals the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further RLF-100 acts on RANTES(CCL5) and could be indicated for treatment of HIV, Cancer and other RANTES specific diseases after further studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Demand / Demand for Expanded Access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- On behalf of Relief Therapeutics, NeuroRX is currently fielding multiple requests from representatives of health ministries, who would like to access RLF-100 for their countries. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- There is currently a high volume of requests for Expanded Access from US licensed physicians &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FDA Fast Track &amp;amp; NeuroRX Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLFTF has a FDA Fast Track designation for the RLF-100 Drug&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; all clinical trials and studies are conducted by Relief Therapeutics partner NeuroRX, a privately held US Company. Relief Therapeutics own all rights on RLF-100 and pays NeuroRX to conduct the trials. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share Price Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is difficult to determine a Share Price for a Stock which this Potential, my personal calculations put the potential between 5-20$. Analysis see the intermediate Share Price target at 18$ which would be a 3600% increase of the current Price.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalysts in the near Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Upcoming Days we expect an announcement of a Partnership with a large drug distribution and logistics Company. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Board member of RLFTF saidduring an interview that by October they will be ready to deliver      treatment to 100&amp;#39;000 patients. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study Results of the Phase 2/3 Study are due in September. Judged by the Expanded Access data, which treats more severe Cases than in the Study, the results are expected to be very good. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is expected that the Data      Monitoring Committee might Stop the study and recommend an approval to the FDA, so that Patients from the Placebo control group can be treated as well.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Exchange, Markets and Regulatory Specifics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLFTF is registered as RLF.SW at the Swiss Stock Exchange and is subject to swiss exchange law&amp;#39;s and regulations. All Management Transactions and Transactions of Significant Shareholders have to be Published according to the Swiss Exchange Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing of (Corporate) News is only allowed off Market (at least 90 minutes prior to Market opening) if News is published during the Market hours, trading will be suspended for some time. There is little chance with this stock for a late &amp;quot;jump-on&amp;quot; once a big catalyst is released, as it will be off-market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US RLFTF is a OTC Traded Stock. RLFTF just filed a OTCQB Application and will therefor also be regulated by the SEC in the future, though i feel the Swiss Regulation is stricter anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information about Market Cap, Outstanding Shares and Expected Earnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a very comprehensive interview by a Swiss Investment Newspaper covering the Above topics, please check out &lt;a href=""https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478""&gt;https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478&lt;/a&gt; , it contains almost everything we want to know at this Point.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Goldman hosted a virtual NDR with Michael Spencer, General Manager - Investor Relations at $MSFT\* yesterday. Goldman has a Buy rating and $235 price target. Here are their takeaways:

1. Azure: Recall, in 4Q20, Azure growth decelerated to 47% yoy (50% cc) compared to 59% growth in 3Q20 (61% cc). Investors continue to focus on the pace of deceleration within Azure, the impact of COVID-19 on cloud migrations and consumption, and changes in the revenue mix between consumption (IaaS and PaaS) and the per user SaaS revenue (EMS). Management noted several puts and takes to the impact of COVID-19 on Azure growth, noting some impact in consumption in heavily impacted industries and a focus on optimization, noting however that the overall trend has been customers redoubling their commitment to migrating to the public cloud. Management added, that as the pace of growth in EMS moderates, with enterprise mobility seats growing 26% yoy in 4Q20 versus 34% in F3Q20, there will be a corresponding impact to overall Azure growth as the revenue mix continues to shift more towards IaaS and PaaS.
2. Commercial Cloud Gross Margins: Management noted continuous improvement in IaaS and PaaS gross margins, as the company continues to expand capacity within its existing datacenter footprint, increase power efficiency, and optimize the company’s existing software stack to run more efficiently. However, management noted the pace of margin expansion within Azure will be partially offset as revenue mixes more towards lower gross margin consumption revenue (and away from SaaS). Recall, in 4Q20 Commercial Cloud gross margins reached 66% (+1pt yoy) compared to 67% in F3Q20 (+4pts yoy), highlighting the impact from moderating revenue growth in the Azure per user business.
3. Office 365: Recall in 4Q20 Office 365 commercial seat growth moderated to 15% yoy, compared to 20% in F3Q20. Management attributed some of the slowdown to better than expected adoption of a 6 month E1 free trial the company introduced following COVID19 (which ended in June) along with some weakness within SMB. Management also noted strength in the pipeline with the opportunity to convert free trial customers to paid users as the trials expire. Management noted continued room for APRU growth driven by SKU migration with a large E1 installed base noting traction in E3 and E5 SKUs; strength in E5 has been driven in part by advanced security and compliance offerings. With respect to Teams, management noted a number of enhancements in recent months as the company continues to close the feature functionality gap relative to competitive offerings in both collaboration and videoconferencing software.
4. Windows: Management highlighted that Windows Commercial continues to grow as a percentage of overall Windows revenue (\~30% as of 2Q20) driving the mix of recurring revenue higher within the segment. Windows Pro, Windows Non-Pro, and Other comprise the remaining \~40%, \~20% and 10% respectively. Management noted commercial PC strength following mid-March shelter in place orders began to fade in 4Q; however, this was offset by strength in the consumer market. Going forward, management pointed to expectations for a low-teens decline in the Windows OEM business driven by continued weakness in SMB and a tough compare.
5. Gaming: With more people working from home, gaming continues to show strength, with gaming revenue growing 64% yoy in F4Q20. Heading into an upcoming console cycle management noted that increased demand associated with WFH should result in lower inventory levels relative to prior console cycles. Management also noted balanced strength throughout the company’s gaming portfolio in 4Q20, with strength in first party titles and the company’s subscription business which surpassed 10mn subscribers in April.",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$MSFT - takeaways from virtual investor meeting at Goldman yesterday,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihlq10,False,dark,0.87,,public,51,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,51,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598566305.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman hosted a virtual NDR with Michael Spencer, General Manager - Investor Relations at $MSFT* yesterday.

,investing,"Just got an email that Vanguard is discontinuing is famous Prime Money Market fund ([VMMXX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VMMXX); [Admiral: VMRXX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VMRXX)) and converting it into the Cash Reserves Federal Money Market Fund, which will only hold government bonds (and equivalents like repos). The email cited the fact that the Prime fund had only slightly higher returns than the Federal (government only) Money Market fund, but at the cost of much higher volatility, especially in March.

The minimum investment for lower-cost admiral shares will be lowered from $millions to $3000.

This doesn't make much of a difference now, since short-term interest rates are pitiful -- 0.04 vs 0.10% for regular and admiral shares.

,investing," What are your thoughts on these 3 stocks? I still think they are 3 great dividend stocks and dividend stocks to buy?

I feel pretty confident in Pfizer, Ratheon, and Exxon as stocks. They distribute great dividends, have a strong and rich history, and aren't going anywhere. Pfizer is in the vaccine race and could be accepted as a vaccine with Operation Warp Speed. Ratheon is a military stock and has some great techology, which will improve over time. 

As a dividend investor, I think that these stocks will be strong over time and continue to be popular stocks amongst the dividend investor community. I'm not a finacial advisor, but I love these 3 stocks and will probably buy Ratheon in the future. I own Pfizer and Exxon at the moment. I believe Exxon will adapt as a company and suck up more energy companies as they go green. 

Waht do you guys think of these 3 stocks?

(2) Do you own any of these stocks?

(3) Did you sell any of these stocks?

,investing,"Getting tired of hearing about uranium yet? If so, then my sincerest apoligies! Feel free to skip over this post and leave the obligatory ""stop pumping uranium"" or ""nuclear power is terrible"" comment at the door. For those that aren't, here is another update on my series of posts about the uranium sector, a sector with the most asymmetrical risk/reward opportunity in the current market.

So, why am I brining you yet another update? Partially to present to you a link that will direct you to a whole library of different analysis reports on the uranium industry as a whole and about specific companies in the sector. There are 105 different reports just for 2020 and more for the previous years. Just search for whatever specific thing you are looking for and read away. Here is the link:
https://uraniumequities.com/research-reports/

However, that is definitely not the only reason I am writing you all another update. In the past few years, a lot of analysts in the uranium sector (best example is Rick Rule) have been saying that a restart of Japanese nuclear power plants would signal the start of a new bull market in the sector. As years passed, the uranium bull case has had plenty of other catalysts to get it going (Kazatomprom and Cameco mine closures and further [supply cuts for the coming 2 years](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2) on Kazatomprom's part, increased number of new power plants constructed and planned in Asia, no significant new mines coming online, more support for nuclear energy in the US and several more that add up to the bull case I have been describing in my previous posts).

Now, the restart of several Japanese nuclear reactors has joined the growing list of catalysts as reported [here:](https://mobile.twitter.com/SStapczynski/status/1296705957020332034)
 
Although it doesn't seem like much of a change in the grand scheme of things, one has to remember Japan still has significant uranium fuel reserves that will now be used to fuel their nuclear reactors, further decreasing the global uranium supply and bringing new demand back online. Since restarts of power plants typically require a significant amount of 'new fuel' to start their power production with the building of a new core, these restarts will only add to the increasing supply deficit as portrayed [here](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/supply-demand) by Cameco 

So why is this time different? Why is it that people have been predicting this thing to happen for years and it hasn't changed? I get exactly why the people that ask this are skeptical and rightly so that they are, because people have been saying it since 2016. What is different now however, is the above mentioned report that Japan is restarting faster than anticipated. Which, as mentioned above, was widely seen as the thing that will light a fire under the sector once more

Now, what does this change about a bull case that was already convincing enough as it is in my opinion? It adds yet another catalyst to the list and further charges up the bull case. Many expected Japan to take several more years to start bringing back their nuclear power plants, so this is a very nice boost for the sector and one many analysts did not take into direct account when calculating the ever increasing supply deficit. But even with most reactors still offline in Japan, the amount of electricity generated by nuclear power plants around the world is now [ back to levels not seens since 2006](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Nuclear-generation-in-2019-close-to-record-high).

TLDR:
The restart of Japanese nuclear power plants is a big positive for the uranium sector, just around a time when there were already several catalysts present for an extremely compelling bull case. Demand is only increasing while supply is being cut by the world's biggest producer Kazatomprom. The deficit is growing and the spot price for uranium will soon increase to incentivize new production.

Prices before were: 200-250, 135-142, 140-170

Now: 500, 210, 288

The fed's have ***doubled*** their money in these ETF's at least.

&gt;In addition, it has purchased bonds in speculative-grade companies as well as ETFs, including the [SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=JNK), a fund in which the Fed holds a $412 billion position.

That could be monitored by looking at SPY.

,investing,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/fed-seen-holding-rates-at-zero-for-five-years-plus-in-new-policy

&gt; The Federal Reserve looks likely to keep short-term interest rates near zero for five years or possibly more after it adopts a new strategy for carrying out monetary policy.

* We are coming off a period where the dollar going into a notable downtrend in relatively quick fashion, and then started to either form a bottom or consolidation. This too happened in 2018 - dollar strength tends to be risk off, and dollar weakness tends to be great for risk assets.

* Volatility starting to grind higher ***despite*** the fact that markets are similarly moving higher.
* Put to call ratio hitting extremely low levels at a time when stocks are strongly overbought.
* Record lows in short interest in major market indexes

Thing is, just like 2018, I can easily see markets continuing to grind higher for at least a little while, and we're clearly not going to see a blowout in a VIX ETN like we did back then. But to say that things feel really stretched right now is a massive understatement.

UTZ/CCH MERGER

Listen up smooth brains, I know youre sick of these crazy premiums, and are looking for the next sleeper pick to jump in on, so here it is.

Tomorrow (8/27/20) at 9am a $CCH shareholder vote will be held to merge blank check/spac company Collier Creek Holdings, with Utz Quality Foods snack giant. And im about to tell you why you should put your chips in (no pun intended).  If the vote goes through, the ticker will change to $UTZ. This is the same SPAC merger structure that Draftkings (DKNG) and Nikola Motors (NKLA) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE)

“Why would I bet on a snack company IPO paulbo? That’s not EVs, gambling, or space travel”

**Well, my friend, semiconductor chips aren’t the only kind of chips you can make money on in the stock market, and ill tell you why.** But first, for those who aren’t aware of UTZ, ill give you a little introduction.

Here is the investor Presentation from august 11th for starters: [http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;iid=11139662](http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;iid=11139662)

**What is UTZ Quality Foods?**

Utz Quality Foods, Inc., more commonly known as Utz, is the largest independent, privately held snack food brand in the United States. Based in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the company produces a wide variety of potato chips, pretzels, and other snacks, with most distribution being limited to the eastern United States.

They are a Manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of branded snacks in the U.S., including potato chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, pork skins, pub/party mixes, and veggie snacks  Strong portfolio of national and regional brands, including Utz, Good Health, Boulder Canyon, Zapp’s, and Golden Flake. If you are familiar with any of these absolutely fire snacks, your probably already buying calls and shares. If not, keep reading.

Utz is 99-year-old family company with over 40 years of consecutive Comparable Sales Growth. It’s the #1 largest privately owned snack company up until now, Its #2 salty snack company in its Core geographies; #4 nationally. 2020E Pro Forma Net Sales of $932 million and Projected Further Adj. EBITDA of $124 million. Yes, almost a billion dollars in sales. This is no start up, this is a blue chip, established company that you have the chance to get in on the ground floor, pre-merger.

**It’s Undervalued**

UTZ is being valued at $1.56 billion. They had a billion in sales. Furthermore, If you happened to catch Jim Cramers bit on it, youll have heard him mention how cheap this valuation is. They came to this valuation at an 11.6x multiple of their EBITDA. Competitors like Pepsico (frito lays) are valued at 14.7x.

As you can see, this valuation is very conservative. Especially when you realize how much growth opportunity UTZ has in comparison to its competitors. It has by far the most growth potential.

As you can see in the investor presentation, the growth in the past 20 years has been flawless. Even in recession, it has grown right on cue. Not only is it a growth stock and undervalued, it is also RECESSION PROOF. And it even has a dividend for those boomers out there. Now you can begin to see why this is such a good play.

**There is tons of room to grow at an exponential rate.**

Utz right now is primarily sold in the north east, but they are going public, so that they can go NATIONAL. Imagine buying a future frito lays when it was worth a couple billion.

“Okay fine Paulbo, it’s a great company, but does it have any real hype driving retail buying?”

Surprisingly it does. This is **Boomer King Jim Cramers** favorite snack company as hes from PA. Hes mentioned this multiple times now on his show. He even had the Executives on in July to talk to him, briefly driving the stock price up to 16$ after hours.

**Warren Buffet** even mentioned that UTZ is his favorite snack company, and thought about buying it back in 2015. [https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/](https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/)  If Berkshire buys into UTZ, this thing is going to the moon.

Don’t underestimate boomer hype. They have the most buying power of all of retail, and going into the uncertainty of the current world situation with the virus and election season they are going to be looking for a solid blue chip dividend play.

**WHALE MONEY IS BUYING THE SPAC ALREADY**

Institutions like Bamco and Goldman Sachs and cch itslef are currently owning 77% of the public float. That is a higher institutional ownership than any spac ive seen so far. They are making big bets on this company, and most big institutions wont even buy spacs until their mergers are complete. The smart money is going to pile on.

On top of all of these great aspects of UTZ, the most important is that their Pretzels are fucking fire. That fact alone makes this play worth it.

**Final valuation and price targets.**

At ticker change, according to the investor presentation, there will be 110 million shares outstanding. Half of them will be owned by the founding family. The other half will be public float. Of that 55 million, 77% will be owned by the current CCH insiders, and the institutions.

Utz is being valued at 1.5 billion. Undervalued af

If Utz is valued at 15x pro forma 2021 Ebitda of 134m, rather than 11.6x, the market cap would be $2 Billion(still even conservative). That would calculate to  $18.12 at ticker change

As I am writing this, the stock is up to $16 dollars, with a few days before ticker change. This is after trading in the 13.50-14.00 range since they announced the merger earlier this summer. The hype is starting to build, but if youre in under $20 YOU ARE STILL VERY EARLY. This will be fairly valued at $20 within a week maybe two, and itll be at $25 eoy.

Positions:

Warrants

Sept and Oct $15, $17.5, $20 calls

Jan $17.5, $20, $25 calls for a longer play.

TL:DR Utz Quality foods snack giant is merging with a spac and is undervalued by like 30-50%. This company is one of the largest and fastest growing snack companys in the country.  The boomers, jim cramer, warren buffet, dividend ETFS and fat people from the north east are going to be loving this stock. Super low risk and a possible high reward with warrants or calls. Premiums are still low on calls, and there is a ton of upside. The company also makes fire pretzels and cheeseballs.",t2_lj8xn,False,,0,False,CCH/UTZ Merger DD UTZ quality foods,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihczb8,False,dark,0.89,,public,35,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,35,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598524801.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was meant for WSB but they dont let you post spacs i guess, so i hope you guys appreciate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the investor Presentation from august 11th for starters: &lt;a href=""http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;amp;T=&amp;amp;Y=&amp;amp;D=&amp;amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;amp;iid=11139662""&gt;http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;amp;T=&amp;amp;Y=&amp;amp;D=&amp;amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;amp;iid=11139662&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is UTZ Quality Foods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utz Quality Foods, Inc., more commonly known as Utz, is the largest independent, privately held snack food brand in the United States. Based in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the company produces a wide variety of potato chips, pretzels, and other snacks, with most distribution being limited to the eastern United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are a Manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of branded snacks in the U.S., including potato chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, pork skins, pub/party mixes, and veggie snacks  Strong portfolio of national and regional brands, including Utz, Good Health, Boulder Canyon, Zapp’s, and Golden Flake. If you are familiar with any of these absolutely fire snacks, your probably already buying calls and shares. If not, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utz is 99-year-old family company with over 40 years of consecutive Comparable Sales Growth. It’s the #1 largest privately owned snack company up until now, Its #2 salty snack company in its Core geographies; #4 nationally. 2020E Pro Forma Net Sales of $932 million and Projected Further Adj. EBITDA of $124 million. Yes, almost a billion dollars in sales. This is no start up, this is a blue chip, established company that you have the chance to get in on the ground floor, pre-merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Undervalued&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UTZ is being valued at $1.56 billion. They had a billion in sales. Furthermore, If you happened to catch Jim Cramers bit on it, youll have heard him mention how cheap this valuation is. They came to this valuation at an 11.6x multiple of their EBITDA. Competitors like Pepsico (frito lays) are valued at 14.7x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this valuation is very conservative. Especially when you realize how much growth opportunity UTZ has in comparison to its competitors. It has by far the most growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the investor presentation, the growth in the past 20 years has been flawless. Even in recession, it has grown right on cue. Not only is it a growth stock and undervalued, it is also RECESSION PROOF. And it even has a dividend for those boomers out there. Now you can begin to see why this is such a good play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is tons of room to grow at an exponential rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utz right now is primarily sold in the north east, but they are going public, so that they can go NATIONAL. Imagine buying a future frito lays when it was worth a couple billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay fine Paulbo, it’s a great company, but does it have any real hype driving retail buying?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly it does. This is &lt;strong&gt;Boomer King Jim Cramers&lt;/strong&gt; favorite snack company as hes from PA. Hes mentioned this multiple times now on his show. He even had the Executives on in July to talk to him, briefly driving the stock price up to 16$ after hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warren Buffet&lt;/strong&gt; even mentioned that UTZ is his favorite snack company, and thought about buying it back in 2015. &lt;a href=""https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/""&gt;https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/&lt;/a&gt;  If Berkshire buys into UTZ, this thing is going to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t underestimate boomer hype. They have the most buying power of all of retail, and going into the uncertainty of the current world situation with the virus and election season they are going to be looking for a solid blue chip dividend play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHALE MONEY IS BUYING THE SPAC ALREADY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions like Bamco and Goldman Sachs and cch itslef are currently owning 77% of the public float. That is a higher institutional ownership than any spac ive seen so far. They are making big bets on this company, and most big institutions wont even buy spacs until their mergers are complete. The smart money is going to pile on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of all of these great aspects of UTZ, the most important is that their Pretzels are fucking fire. That fact alone makes this play worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final valuation and price targets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ticker change, according to the investor presentation, there will be 110 million shares outstanding. Half of them will be owned by the founding family. The other half will be public float. Of that 55 million, 77% will be owned by the current CCH insiders, and the institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utz is being valued at 1.5 billion. Undervalued af&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Utz is valued at 15x pro forma 2021 Ebitda of 134m, rather than 11.6x, the market cap would be $2 Billion(still even conservative). That would calculate to  $18.12 at ticker change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am writing this, the stock is up to $16 dollars, with a few days before ticker change. This is after trading in the 13.50-14.00 range since they announced the merger earlier this summer. The hype is starting to build, but if youre in under $20 YOU ARE STILL VERY EARLY. This will be fairly valued at $20 within a week maybe two, and itll be at $25 eoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept and Oct $15, $17.5, $20 calls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan $17.5, $20, $25 calls for a longer play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR Utz Quality foods snack giant is merging with a spac and is undervalued by like 30-50%. This company is one of the largest and fastest growing snack companys in the country.  The boomers, jim cramer, warren buffet, dividend ETFS and fat people from the north east are going to be loving this stock. Super low risk and a possible high reward with warrants or calls. Premiums are still low on calls, and there is a ton of upside. The company also makes fire pretzels and cheeseballs.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then and many years of disappointment, Blackberry has been slowly transforming into a leader in the software industry, most notably with their QNX technology.

Last year, they had 150 million cars installed with their technology and as of their last earnings report, they increased this number to 175 million which is a growth of 17%.  This is around 30% of the market share of modern cars and upper management projects they can gain up to 60-70% of the market share in the next years.

The automobile industry is down and this has caused Blackberry to go down a bit. However, Blackberry has recently won bids with Hyundai and Volvo which is something to look forward to. Once the automobile industry goes back up, Blackberry will most likely follow.

There is also the promise of 5G coming out soon. As per Blackberry,  5G will lead to more attacks on ""mobile endpoints"". This is where Blackberry comes in as they also have the ""Spark Suites"" which solves this problem. Although they just came out with this platform, it has been very well perceived by their customers.

lastly, they recently announced that Xpeng P7 will be using the QNX Technology. Xpeng is one of the leading electric vehicles in China.  This is great news (which is why it went up 6.28%) as most of their revenues come from North America and this is a great market to expand to.

There are other products that have been doing good for Blackberry (Athoc), but these are the main reasons I am bullish on this stock.

Currently, Blackberry is not seen as innovative since they have been primarily seen as a phone maker, but now they are well diversified in the software business and have been building their products and focusing a lot on R&amp;D.

With the most recent crisis there was an actual rationale as to why growth would outperform; most tech is considered ""growth"" and a lot of tech companies actually did do well with everyone at home. So I went back to the earlier days and looked at the great recession, and it surprised me.

""For F4Q20 results on Sept 10th, we expect the company to report 1,094mn subscribers, 208K net adds vs. FactSet consensus of 199k and guidance for 154K-164K, and adj.

,investing,"I am posting this here instead of the Daily Advice Thread because I believe (hope) it will be relevant to any investor looking into protecting short term gains in this crazy volatile market and am looking to spur a conversation about both tax management strategy and position protection.

I am sitting on a 200% gain from a mid March purchase of a covid high flying tech stock.  If I sell now, I lock in the profit, but the trade will be taxed as a ""short term capital gain (STCG)"".  If I sell for the same price in March 2021 the trade counts as a ""long term capital gain (LTCG)"" and my tax bill is significantly smaller.  However, the earnings report for the stock is a month away, covid news ranges from promising to dreary daily and there is election on the horizon.  The stock could continue to be a high flyer or come crashing down based on any of those factors.  For the sake of argument, lets say the difference in the tax bill between STCG and LTCG is $20K.  

Lets talk about options for protecting this position while maximizing tax savings:

1. Conservative Approach - Sell now, pocket the money but pay STCG - this has an opportunity cost of $20K (the difference between STCG and LTCG)
2. Buy ""insurance"" to protect against a significant drop in price - Buying March 2021 ""puts"" at the current strike price to cover the position will cost about $500. If the price stays the same or goes up, the put expires worthless and I loose $500 but avoid paying the $20K STCG/LTCG differential.   
This seems like a no-brainer way to protect a position long enough to recover the tax differential.
   1.  Not so fast!  It turns out the options trade itself has the same STCG/LTCG problem if it makes money.  So, if the position drops by $100K and I exercise the put, the position is protected, but I owe STCG (.35) on the $100K gain from the put.  
3. Plan for significant volatility -  Setting up a March 2021 options straddle   (buying puts and calls at the current strike price) will cost approximately $1000, but it has the benefit of protecting the position in the event of a huge decline and providing even more exposure to a big price increase. If price stays the same, but the put and all expire worthless and I am out $1K (still significantly better than the $20K differential)
   1. Again I will have a STCG problem on the option itself

What i'm seeing right now is a huge spike in tech stocks and biotech. NVDA for example is up 150% since the March dip, and that seems fairly average for most equities, with some up almost 400%.

,investing,"I read an article that claimed that Bitcoin tended to lead stocks market changes, but this was the usual tea leaf reading and chart-staring.

So I decided to compute the cross-correlation function of daily bitcoin percentage changes with SP500 daily percentage changes, from 2015 to today.

Plot here: https://i.imgur.com/zNHSzZK.png

The big white peak shows that bitcoin and stocks move in parallel on the same day (zero time lag).

But the broad bump in the red boxcar-smoothed correlation function suggests that bitcoin prices changes today are correlated with SP500 changes over the upcoming week.   

However the SP500 seems to have little or no predictive power for Bitcoin, because there's no peak to the left of zero.


---- 

NOTE: the [cross-correlation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) is defined as  

c(t) = ∫ 𝝙BTC(𝜏 )/BTC((𝜏 ) ⨉ 𝝙SP500(𝜏 +t)/SP500(𝜏 +t)d𝜏   

so that if BTC(𝜏 ) tends move the same as SP500(𝜏+t) for many  𝜏 then c(t) should have a peak at t.

-----

edit - a simple hypothesis:  The zero-lag (white) correlation is obviously just normal correlated markets. The longer (red) correlation represents an internal lag time to the stock market in responding to events.  For example a negative event causes a crash in both BTC and SP500.  The Bitcoin falls fast, and stops, but SP500 reacts slowly and the sell-off  takes a few days to complete.    

As an analogy, an earthquake knocks down a building (BTC), and also sets off a huge landslide (SP500), but the big landslide tends to be followed by a series of smaller landslides.     The building's fall ""predicted"" the multi-day landslide, but it's not a useful prediction, because you could have looked at the initial landslide and known that more landslides tend to follow.

Any opinions on this.

We reiterate our belief that contributions like this, although this was larger than most, are a normal course of business for a regulated utility attempting to influence energy legislation or at least countering the arguments of others with opposite interests.

In our opinion, the timeline of currently public events in the alleged bribery is inconsistent with FirstEnergy’s management being directly involved. In late 2016, FirstEnergy’s management separated from FirstEnergy Solutions’ management and an independent FES board was named. In April 2018, FirstEnergy reached an agreement with FES’ creditors and FES filed for bankruptcy. One year later, in April 2019, HB 6 was introduced and signed into law in July. Earlier this year, FES emerged from bankruptcy and changed its name to Energy Harbor.

We reiterate our belief that the market has overreacted to the bribery charges. Energy Harbor owned the two nuclear plants subsidized by HB 6 and was separate from FirstEnergy well before the legislation was introduced.

We know that elections can often be a game changer and make markets plunge if there are big policy changes. But then again it can work the opposite.

Divide your 5%, let's say 50k$ into 5 portions.

Buy 1/5th on a specific date in **September**.

Buy 1/5th on a same date in **October**

Buy 1/5th on a same date in **November**

U.S. consumer confidence fell for second straight month in August as households worried about the economic outlook.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 84.8 this month from 91.7 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to a reading of 93 in August.

Largest disconnect between consumer confidence and equity valuations ever.

Will this translate into anything or will Jay Powell manage to fix this too?

,investing,"Goldman hosted a virtual investor meeting yesterday with $DAL\* CEO Ed Bastian and CFO Paul Jacobson. The discussions focused on demand recovery and the company's ability to adapt costs to the uncertain demand outlook. Here are the key takeaways:

1. Commenting on the current demand environment, management noted that this has held relatively steady at down \~75% year-over-year for the last four to six weeks, underlying which business demand remains down a more depressed -86% to -88% year-over-year. However, more recently the company has seen a very modest uptick in bookings, likely driven in part by the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend. Given that bookings remain relatively close-in, the company does not currently have much clarity around fall demand, but expects to have a better view post-Labor Day.
2. Due to ongoing demand uncertainty, the company remains committed to its flexible planning approach. Currently, Delta’s planning guardrails are for summer 2021 capacity to be down 20% to 40% vs. 2019 levels. If the demand recovery by summer 2021 requires a capacity cut of greater than 40%, the company believes there is room to flex down further. However, if demand were to recover in a more V-shaped fashion than most airline managements and we believe is likely, it would be difficult for Delta to cut capacity less than 20% given previously announced headcount reductions and aircraft retirements.
3. Delta anticipates that its unit costs (“CASM”) coming out of the crisis will be lower than pre-COVID levels given various cost savings across the organization, including labor and the fleet. On the former, the company highlighted that 17,000 employees, or \~20% of its workforce, have already elected to participate in voluntary retirement/separation programs. The majority of participants in these programs were more senior and therefore at the higher end of the pay scale, which should result in lower labor costs even as Delta/the industry scale back up as demand recovers, further aided by productivity gains the company is planning to leverage. With respect to fleet-driven savings, management highlighted its previously announced aircraft retirement plans would accelerate its fleet simplification process and reduce expenses going forward tied to improved fuel burn, fewer training events, reduced spare parts inventory, etc.
4. With Delta planning for both capacity and costs to be down \~50% year-over-year in the Dec Q, the company continues to anticipate that further cash burn improvement will largely hinge on demand. However, management commented that potential further fleet simplification actions could drive additional costs out of the business.
5. Delta reiterated that it does not currently plan to draw on its loan allocation under the current CARES Act given the associated restrictions and as it has other options to raise additional liquidity if necessary. Looking forward, there have been discussions of a potential airline provision in a new proposed stimulus package (or “CARES 2”), which could include an extension of the Payroll Support Program (currently slated to end September 30th). Management noted that these discussions, which started out as a union-driven initiative, have bipartisan support in the US government and that a relatively larger CARES 2 package would increase the likelihood of the airlines provision being included.
6. Management currently does not plan to back away from its long-standing strategy to strengthen its global network through partnerships with various international airlines.

I'm sure covid-19 won't be the last pandemic that the world will face (in fact, Bill Gates has warned us for years about this). So the incentive to protect  business from current and future health crisis will only get bigger. And with the immense Google tech backing it, Coefficient Insurance can easily tailor its insurance policy to meet the need/risk of each employer.

I believe this is the right move for Google given the current circumstance and the rising hype about online data-driven insurance-related business (ie,  LMND and DCT). So I expect more upside to Google stock in the near future.

Sales of newly built homes soared across the nation in July, as pent-up demand from the shutdown spring market, urban flight and a new desire for more work-at-home space fueled the growth.

As measured by signed contracts, new home sales jumped 13.9% compared with June and were a remarkable 36.3% higher annually, according to the U.S. Census. June’s reading was also revised higher. This is the strongest one-month pace since 2006.

This is the third consecutive month of sizable sales gains, after sales dropped dramatically in March and April, due to the onset of the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/coronavirus-live-updates.html). 

Strong demand sucked up the inventory of newly built homes for sale, which fell to a four-month supply from a 4.7-month supply in June. 

“The new home market has everything going for it right now including limited resale supply, fear of missing out, heightened dissatisfaction of our current living situation, low mortgage rates, months of saving money, and increased demand from key demographic cohorts,” said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Meyers Research.

Low supply and strong demand made it easier for builders to raise prices. The median price of a newly built home sold in July was $330,600, an increase of 7.2% compared with July 2019.

“With larger homes, greener backyards, garages and home offices ranking at the top of home buyers’ lists, new homes in the suburbs fit the bill and have been a welcome answer to a housing market parched for existing inventory,” said George Ratiu, senior economist at realtor.com. “Builders have recognized the acute need for more construction and have moved to fill the gap. The main concern hovering over the market is whether the rising costs of building materials will drive prices even higher.”

Lumber prices are up more than 100% since mid-April, as mills shut down in the spring and did not expect to see such strong demand so quickly. There are also higher tariffs on imports of lumber.

Buyers are taking advantage of low mortgage rates, which give them additional purchasing power but also tend to juice home prices. The average rate on the 30-year fixed set two record lows in July, when these sales contracts were signed.

Regionally, sales gains were strongest in the Midwest and the South but dropped in the Northeast on a monthly basis. The Northeast tends to be the most volatile read, as it has the smallest concentration of new construction. Sales saw a modest monthly increase in the West but were up a strong 41% annually.",t2_7oifwd0j,False,,0,False,[CNBC] Sales of newly built homes surge 36% in July,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iggfj5,False,dark,0.84,,public,20,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,20,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598404364.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/sales-of-newly-built-homes-surge-36percent-in-july.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/sales-of-newly-built-homes-surge-36percent-in-july.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Exchange operator Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) has filed with U.S. regulators to change its rules to enable companies that debut on the stock market through a direct listing to raise capital, as an alternative to an initial public offering.

The move underscores a desire for an alternative route to the public markets to an IPO, for decades the avenue used by the likes of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), amid criticism by venture capital firms that investment banks underprice IPOs to help investors score big gains.

[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/?utm_source=BusinessWire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=InstagramCheckout)   (Nasdaq: BIGC), a leading open SaaS ecommerce platform for  fast-growing  and established brands, today announced the availability  of [checkout on Instagram](https://business.instagram.com/shopping/checkout)   for eligible US merchants. BigCommerce merchants can be among the  first  to adopt the new feature, which provides shoppers an intuitive,   seamless and secure way to purchase products they discover on Instagram   in a few clicks, without leaving the app.

Leveraging   BigCommerce’s native integration with Facebook Commerce Manager,   merchants can easily connect their ecommerce storefront’s catalog to   Instagram and give customers the ability to buy from their favorite   brands directly on Instagram—rather than navigating to a brand’s website   to make a purchase—and pay using PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, American   Express or Discover. After placing an order, customers can also use the   Instagram app to view their order status, estimated delivery date and   tracking number, as well as cancel orders, initiate returns or request   additional support.

""Creating  a  streamlined checkout experience is paramount for merchants looking to   social commerce to drive revenue growth. The rollout of checkout on   Instagram is another significant step in Instagram’s evolution toward   becoming an essential commerce channel for customer-focused brands,""   said Brent Bellm, chief executive officer at BigCommerce. ""BigCommerce   is proud to be one of a select group of partners to offer their   customers access to this innovative new feature at launch.""

basically J Powell (feds) will have a meeting to decide whether they will increase inflation from 2%  at the moment inflation is fixed at staying near the 2% limit. 

&amp;#x200B;

If Powell has his way, he will try to increase inflation to something like 4-5% to stimulate the economy

The way to increase inflation is that 

1. treasury creates bonds, 

2. treasury sells them to banks, (banks make profit on interest), 

3. they sell the bonds to banks, 

4. the  feds  write a cheque, 

5. the banks then get treasury to print more money while cashing in their cheques.

&amp;#x200B;

When you increase inflation, you devalue the currency

,investing,"Hey everyone, I recently got this options strategy from this company based in the US called the Nanban Foundation. It seems very promising, but it took a while to understand it (the English was a bit broken). I managed to translate it, and I need help evaluating this.

Anyway, here it is:

This is for SPY STOCK (S&amp;P 500)

1. SELL a PUT (with a strike at 5 dollars above the current market price of SPY) and SELL a CALL (with a strike at 5 dollars below the current market price of SPY) both for a Premium ($X)

2. BUY a PUT for a premium of 20% of $X

3. BUY a CALL for a premium of 10% of $X

4. Create CLOSING ORDERS for Step 1 by spending 10% of $X. For example, If $X=1.00, create a CLOSING ORDER for when the SELL PUT and SELL CALL’s premium reaches 0.90.

5. Create a CLOSING ORDER for Step 2 when the premium quadruples.

6. Create a CLOSING ORDER for Step 3 when the premium doubles or quadruples.

7. If the CLOSING ORDER for step 5 executes, repeat steps 2, 5, 7 except when repeating step 2, you have to do it for a premium of 20% of the premium of the EXECUTED CLOSING ORDER. If not, disregard this step.

8. If the CLOSING ORDER for step 6 executes, repeat steps 3, 6, 8 except when repeating step 3, you have to do it for a premium of 10% of the premium of the EXECUTED CLOSING ORDER. If not, disregard this step.

35% - Short term treasury bills

15% - Emerging markets equities

15% - US small cap value

Interested in any feedback from investors who have a decent portion of their wealth in cryptocurrency and are utilizing DeFi. If you're not familiar with the term, in the crypto money community, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) encompasses sets of protocols which fill the roles of a central bank. An entire ""crypto banking"" layer has evolved on top of assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that allow users to:

(a) Remain in full control &amp; possession of their assets by utilizing offline storage &amp; hardware wallets.  
(b) Allow for lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest on crypto assets.

I think it's apparent—in the US at least—that there's really no intrinsic value to the dollar, most people do not have money, simply currency. I can't help but feel that between public awareness of how markets work, COVID, extreme partisanship in government and a calculated effort by the Federal Reserve to devalue the $USD through QE that soon the bubble is going to burst, and it's time to pay the piper. The magnitude of the $USD collapse would be catastrophic for anyone left holding the bag (most people).

Is there anyone who has a large share of their wealth in cryptocurrency that has tested the waters of DeFi?

I am particularly interested in feedback from those who have placed a good portion of their net worth into crypto banking systems, actively taking part in lending, asset pools, governance, or any other ""bankless"" financial system. Understanding that this whole sector is far from mature:

* Has anything struck you as being a major flaw in the setup of crypto banking as it stands?
* Do you feel (assuming proper precautions of utilizing hardware wallets/key ownership are followed) that your assets are as secure within DeFi systems as they are just being held in your wallet?
* With maturation, do you believe DeFi will surpass traditional markets?

Just getting started looking into moving cryptocurrency holdings into DeFi systems, so any and all constructive advice would be appreciated!

These are all fairly popular in the retail investing community since they pay monthly dividends and I'm curious to know if anyone else is investing into them or has divested from them owing to the consequences of covid?

STOR was bought again by Berkshire, which is a keen sign of confidence.

My next purchase, soon, after I was able to read more about the after initially thinking they'd crater.

GOOD and MAIN I know less about. GOOD runs long term leases for factories and office buildings (I know). They did seem to pull out of the last recession very well.

,investing,"I’m a complete noob who started learning about options trading like a couple days ago, so please bear with me if I say something stupid.

I know that with an iron condor strategy you make money when the price of the underlying stock is greater than the short put strike - premium and less than the short call strike + premium.

Let’s say that the value of the underlying stock falls outside that range before expiration—we mitigate our loss using a buy call and buy put with the iron condor strategy. But in the end we still suffer a set loss.

My question is, can we avoid that loss by setting close orders for the buy calls and buy puts that activate when the premiums of those contracts increase buy 4 times and then just setting up a new buy call/put for a premium for the same price as the initial buy put and call?

For example, let’s say the value of XYZ stock is 75 dollars at the beginning of the iron condor trade.

After a few days, let’s say that the price of the XYZ stock is increasing more than we expect and it’s approaching 90. What if we just close the BUY 90 CALL option before XYZ hits the strike price of the BUY 90 CALL and then immediately enter a BUY 95 CALL?

&lt;p&gt;I know that with an iron condor strategy you make money when the price of the underlying stock is greater than the short put strike - premium and less than the short call strike + premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that the value of the underlying stock falls outside that range before expiration—we mitigate our loss using a buy call and buy put with the iron condor strategy. But in the end we still suffer a set loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, can we avoid that loss by setting close orders for the buy calls and buy puts that activate when the premiums of those contracts increase buy 4 times and then just setting up a new buy call/put for a premium for the same price as the initial buy put and call?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say the value of XYZ stock is 75 dollars at the beginning of the iron condor trade. Then we engage in an iron condor trade with a BUY 60 PUT @ 1.00, SELL 65 PUT @ 2.00, SEL 85 CALL @ 2.00, BUY 90 CALL @ 1.00. After a few days, let’s say that the price of the XYZ stock is increasing more than we expect and it’s approaching 90.

# U.S. Poised to Charge Teva in Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe

Aug. 25, 2020, 2:16 PM

U.S. prosecutors are preparing to charge Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. with conspiring with competitors to raise prices for generic drugs, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Justice Department is planning to charge Teva as soon as Tuesday after the company rebuffed a settlement that would have required paying a criminal penalty and admitting wrongdoing, said the person, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.

A spokesperson for Teva, which is based in Israel, declined to comment.

# Drug firm bets it won't be charged

In the coming days, the Justice Department will decide whether to file criminal charges against one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies suspected of colluding with rivals to inflate the prices of widely used drugs.

The company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, is betting that in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the Trump administration won't dare to come down hard on the largest supplier of generic drugs in the United States.

It is a high-stakes gamble that could affect millions of Americans who rely on Teva's dozens of inexpensive generic drugs, as well as its brand-name products like Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis, and Ajovy, for migraines. Teva officials say criminal charges could cripple the Israeli company and potentially leave it unable to sell drugs to federal programs like Medicare.

For years, the Justice Department and state prosecutors have been investigating what they describe as a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies to increase the prices of popular drugs. The department has already extracted guilty pleas and $224 million in penalties from four other drug companies.

Lawyers for Teva, which prosecutors believe was deeply involved in the conspiracy, until recently had been holding settlement negotiations with officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division. But in April, the company all but walked away from the talks, according to people on both sides of the discussions.",t2_112r0h,False,,0,False,ALERT -- TEVA Charged For Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_igibr1,False,dark,0.45,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,1598385013.0,,[],{},,True,,1598409877.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run for your life ...&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hey everyone, my friend and I are very into stocks. We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” &gt; “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock (useful for Rate My Portfolio).
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

We hope this is helpful!

,investing,"**TLDR at the bottom**

As the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.

**Objective:**

SOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is ""focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.""

**Opinion:**

I believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.

**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency

**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards

**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards

SOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))

**Opinion:**

Whether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:

**Objective:**

What type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as ""manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others."" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.

**Opinion:**

Think about some of the ""hot"" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.

Many people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.

Based on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its ""hype"" or its ""meme/moon potential""). I can see that happening with SOAC.

Speaking of the management team...

**Objective:**

CEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard

CFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT

Chairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota

**Opinion:**

Good mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.

Based on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.

**Objective:**

SOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20

**Opinion:**

SOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.

**Objective:**

SOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))

**Opinion:**

The timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.

What that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.

**Final thoughts:**

SOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.

**Disclaimer:**

I have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.

**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",t2_6j4na0aj,False,,0,False,"Opinion: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) is a possible value sector to target for investing in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus (&lt;a href=""https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf""&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as &amp;quot;manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others.&amp;quot; They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about some of the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; investments sectors right now. I&amp;#39;m talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC&amp;#39;s target comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company&amp;#39;s chance of success based on the public&amp;#39;s excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its &amp;quot;hype&amp;quot; or its &amp;quot;meme/moon potential&amp;quot;). I can see that happening with SOAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the management team...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &amp;gt; $1.50 and don&amp;#39;t even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 (&lt;a href=""https://www.greenspac.com/""&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;nvironmental, &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ocial, &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT&amp;#39;s current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi, I have a dummy question about bonds / fixed income.

Stock / equity, I understand - if I invest $10k into Stock, it goes up or down, I gain / lose money accordingly. Got it.

Bonds on the other hand - if I invest $10k into Bonds, are the following assumptions true?

(i) It pays a certain coupon rate semi-annually which defines my yield - ie, the rate of return - let's say 4.0%

(ii) but there's also the ""mark to market"" or ""valuation"" component similar to Stocks - ie, the value of my Bonds (ie what people / the open market will pay for it) may increase or decrease as the interest rate (say the 3/5/10 year treasury yields) move down or up. Does this also get factored into my ""rate of return""? And consequently making me sensitive to interest rate risk?

Broadly, I'm just trying to figure out - if my $10k investment into a some sort of a bond index fund 5 years ago is now worth $12k, is that a combination of (i) and (ii) above? And similarly, if that investment is now worth only $9k, can I effectively assume that the yield I earned on (i) was more than offset by the losses incurred by (ii)?

,investing,"Fairly new trader/investor, been swing trading and trading options for the past 4 months.

Been looking into ETFs and dividend stocks as i think they would give more of a return than my .05% savings account...

I was wondering how covered calls work with dividends however, i haven't found a straightforward answer.

I own 100 shares of XOM.

I sell covered calls each week to increase my return.

What happens if:

1. I sell my call before the ex-dividend date and it hits the strike and i lose my shares
2. I sell my call after the ex-dividend date and it hits the strike and i lose my shares

Im pretty sure if i sell calls before or after and they expire, ill still get my dividend but i was curious how losing them works.

Im also imagining if i sell puts before purchasing the stock, i just need to actually own 100 shares before the ex-dividend date, and then switch to covered calls until the dividend date passes?

&lt;p&gt;Been looking into ETFs and dividend stocks as i think they would give more of a return than my .05% savings account...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how covered calls work with dividends however, i haven&amp;#39;t found a straightforward answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own 100 shares of XOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sell covered calls each week to increase my return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sell my call before the ex-dividend date and it hits the strike and i lose my shares&lt;/li&gt;

I've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.

I'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.

Reasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):

* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&amp;P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.
* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).
* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&amp;P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.
* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write ""hello world"" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.
* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.

Reasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)

* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.
* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.
* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.
* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of ""eyeballs"".
* (opinion) ""this time is different"". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger ""paradigm shift"" than what we are seeing today. I used ""paradigm shift"", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).
* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).
* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&amp;P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&amp;P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.

You can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.

I'll end with a few random thoughts:

* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.
* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario. There is also the worry of a slump in earnings due to general economic malaise, but that is a garden variety concern that everyone is watching for and usually pretty temporary.

,investing,"**Goldman:** ""After an initial slowdown in the wake of shelter in place orders enacted in mid-March and transitioning to WFH catalyzed shifts in near-term IT spending priorities, our conversations point to continued improvement throughout the quarter with the potential for accelerated investment in digital transformation initiatives. However, we note that visibility into IT budgets in 2H20 and the potential overhang from continued macro uncertainty remains limited. That said, we continue to view Salesforce as well positioned to capitalize on long-term secular tailwinds underpinning digital transformation efforts across industries and at current levels believe investor expectations remain somewhat muted. We continue to believe CRM represents one of the most strategic assets in software. We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $220.""

**Morgan Stanley:** ""CRM: Stable Demand Against Low Expectations Paves Way for Positive 2H21 Revisions. Recent rounds of checks with large SI partners of Salesforce suggest a better than feared demand environment given a broad, diversified product portfolio and stable renewal rates versus low expectations for the quarter. The headwinds to Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud picked up in our April quarter conversations continued into 2Q, as marketing budgets remain depressed and focus has shifted more towards efficiency projects instead of growth-oriented projects. That said, the tailwinds to Service Cloud and Commerce Cloud from work from home and shelter in place mandates, as well as strong demand trends for Mulesoft appear to have sustained through Q2. Looking ahead, partners expect a gradual recovery into Q3 and Q4, as digital transformation projects slowly begin to come back onto the priority list. This demand expectation contrasts favorably to management's more cautious guidance that assumes the spending environment does not improve until CY21 despite the better business trends seen in April and May, which leaves us confident in positive estimate revisions into 2HFY21 (relative to much of the software group where near-term expectations have proven too high to increase further with 2Q results). With shares lagging the broader software group YTD (+20% vs. the group +41% YTD) and trading at \~7.7x CY21e recurring revenue vs. the software group at \~13.4x, positive 2HFY21 estimate revisions and CRM's strong secular growth story seem underpriced at current levels, keeping us Overweight into results.""

**BMO:** "" Given conservative guidance, we think salesforce will meet and likely surpass consensus metrics for cRPO, billings, and revenues. While we are leaving our estimates unchanged, we are raising our target price to $230 and reiterate our Outperform rating. We continue to believe that salesforce may look at add to its capabilities and growth in FY22 through M&amp;A, and we offer our thoughts on potential opportunities in monitoring and workflow, amongst other areas.""

**Jefferies:** ""Our survey of 50+ partners indicates 42% saw their CRM pipelines improve over the past three months; however, we are still not back to normal levels as 32% of partners were below plan (19% above and 51% below). The setup for F2Q looks attractive given the improving pipelines combined with a conservative guide. We believe that CRM is valued attractively at 7.6x EV/2021E rev vs group at 9.7x.

However, we note that visibility into IT budgets in 2H20 and the potential overhang from continued macro uncertainty remains limited. That said, we continue to view Salesforce as well positioned to capitalize on long-term secular tailwinds underpinning digital transformation efforts across industries and at current levels believe investor expectations remain somewhat muted. We continue to believe CRM represents one of the most strategic assets in software. We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $220.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morgan Stanley:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;CRM: Stable Demand Against Low Expectations Paves Way for Positive 2H21 Revisions. Recent rounds of checks with large SI partners of Salesforce suggest a better than feared demand environment given a broad, diversified product portfolio and stable renewal rates versus low expectations for the quarter. The headwinds to Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud picked up in our April quarter conversations continued into 2Q, as marketing budgets remain depressed and focus has shifted more towards efficiency projects instead of growth-oriented projects. That said, the tailwinds to Service Cloud and Commerce Cloud from work from home and shelter in place mandates, as well as strong demand trends for Mulesoft appear to have sustained through Q2. Looking ahead, partners expect a gradual recovery into Q3 and Q4, as digital transformation projects slowly begin to come back onto the priority list. This demand expectation contrasts favorably to management&amp;#39;s more cautious guidance that assumes the spending environment does not improve until CY21 despite the better business trends seen in April and May, which leaves us confident in positive estimate revisions into 2HFY21 (relative to much of the software group where near-term expectations have proven too high to increase further with 2Q results). With shares lagging the broader software group YTD (+20% vs. the group +41% YTD) and trading at ~7.7x CY21e recurring revenue vs. the software group at ~13.4x, positive 2HFY21 estimate revisions and CRM&amp;#39;s strong secular growth story seem underpriced at current levels, keeping us Overweight into results.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMO:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot; Given conservative guidance, we think salesforce will meet and likely surpass consensus metrics for cRPO, billings, and revenues. While we are leaving our estimates unchanged, we are raising our target price to $230 and reiterate our Outperform rating. We continue to believe that salesforce may look at add to its capabilities and growth in FY22 through M&amp;amp;A, and we offer our thoughts on potential opportunities in monitoring and workflow, amongst other areas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jefferies:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Our survey of 50+ partners indicates 42% saw their CRM pipelines improve over the past three months; however, we are still not back to normal levels as 32% of partners were below plan (19% above and 51% below). The setup for F2Q looks attractive given the improving pipelines combined with a conservative guide. We believe that CRM is valued attractively at 7.6x EV/2021E rev vs group at 9.7x. Maintain Buy and raise PT to $235.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RBC:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot; Our checks suggest improving underlying business momentum. Given discounted valuation and increased likelihood of outperformance across most guided metrics, we like the risk/reward trade and raise our price target to $220 (from $210).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Just some backstory:
I just turned 17, I work making ~600 dollars a month part time 
I have $5000 dollars invested currently, namely in QQQ, Microsoft, USB, Kellogg, and an S&amp;p500 ETF, these are all long term stocks, I’m holding onto them all for at least a year as then I get that tax deduction, but likely will hold onto them way longer 
I have another 5000 in the bank right now which I probably will put into a Roth IRA, investing in some growth stocks I guess? Completely tax free :). Haven’t totally thought that part through 100% yet so not sure about what investments I will pursue there 
And then I have another $500 of just money in cash and on my debit card 
I’ve always been really into finance, followed stocks and researched them since end of middle school. In the future I want to be a financial manager for a company I think, but still have a very open mind on what I want to do. Starting a. Business seems cool too but very daunting to me.

I feel like I’ve been pretty fortunate, I save almost all the money I receive which is part of the reason I have a decent amount saved up
Also, any other sort of things I can be investing in besides stocks that are worthwhile and good investments?

I believe the recent lawsuit is actually brought on by another network who sees them as a threat, or wants to lower their value to potentially buy them out. While I see it as an entry point for all.

The stock spiked on every one of these announcements. $1 to $11 on June 3rd, another spike on July 2nd, and again on Aug 3rd. It hasn't stayed, but it seems we are due for another at any moment (End of Aug/beginning of Sept?) I believe this is a great company with massive growth potential. Due to their recent collaboration with Amazon Prime, I believe they will get picked up or bought out by Amazon, (if not Viacom or ATT due to their quickly growing threat to Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network).

&lt;p&gt;I believe the recent lawsuit is actually brought on by another network who sees them as a threat, or wants to lower their value to potentially buy them out. While I see it as an entry point for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock spiked on every one of these announcements. $1 to $11 on June 3rd, another spike on July 2nd, and again on Aug 3rd. It hasn&amp;#39;t stayed, but it seems we are due for another at any moment (End of Aug/beginning of Sept?) I believe this is a great company with massive growth potential. Due to their recent collaboration with Amazon Prime, I believe they will get picked up or bought out by Amazon, (if not Viacom or ATT due to their quickly growing threat to Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current positions: 20x 9/18 $1.5c + 10,000 shares&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,1,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,268,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,268,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

I'm currently paying two mortgages due to this. Because of this, it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to invest in more real estate.

I have a downpayment and a manageable mortgage and just want to grow my nest egg, so I invest ~40% of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a rental property that most likely will be vacated due to coronavirus once evictions resume. I&amp;#39;m not collecting rent and will have to seek payment once the memorandium is removed. I&amp;#39;m currently paying two mortgages due to this. Because of this, it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to invest in more real estate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home improvement material costs have risen terribly. Estimates to remodel my home are extremely high (30% higher than Dec) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small businesses are essentially dead in my area. Its been a dream of mine to invest in a resturant but that seems unrealistic for the time being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,investing,"For many years, I have been an advocate of the Three-Fund Portfolio and, in general, the Boglehead approach to investing.  Roughly 90% of my portfolio still exists in this format, with an allocation of 61% domestic, 14% international, and 25% bond.

Recently, I built up a model of all of my finances:

* ""static"" expenses (things that don't increase over time, like mortgage payments, student loan payments, and auto payments)
* ""dynamic"" expense (those that do increase over time with inflation, like daycare, property tax, and the electric bill
* Income, with a metric for annual increases
* Investments, with allocation, historical yield, and standard deviation

All of this was set to answer the question: ""When am I likely to be able to retire?""  The finish line would be based on the logic: 25 times the amount of ($100,000/year inflation adjusted plus any remaining ""static"" expenses).  So if the mortgage was the only expense left and you pay $50k a year on that, my target would be $150k * 25 = $3,750,000.  That allows me to pull 4% per year more or less forever.

The model was run on a monthly basis, proceeding until the mark is hit, stores the retirement age, and then repeats 10,000 times.  Each month, the monthly return is calculated for each investment vehicle by generating a normally distributed random number, multiplying that by the fund's standard deviation, and adding it to the weighted mean return.  In this way, I include all of the random walk of the market.

When putting in the numbers, something drastic stood out to me:

Fund|Annual Return|Standard Deviation
:-:|:-:|:-:
Domestic|7.84%|19.48%
International|4.27%|15.20%
Bond|5.28%|3.07%

Why the hell do I have any money in the international fund?  While not a ""complete"" data set, the International Fund source data is back to 1996, so it's a reasonable 24-year sample.  Yields are lower than bonds, with standard deviation 5x as high.

Where's the benefit?  ""Diversification"" by itself is a rough answer, especially given the weight that the US Market has on foreign markets.

,investing,"I’ve been debating about switching from VIOO into VIOV to capture the size effect and the value premium. It’s been shown that small cap value tends to outperform any other stock asset class over the long term. But the last 10 years or so have been horrible for value investors. I know past performance doesn’t indicate anything for the future, but 10 years of underperformance is horrible if your investment horizon to really grow your wealth is 30 - 40 years.

Why not just hold a blended fund to guarantee yourself you will capture the size effect and not make any effort to tilt one way towards value or growth? By holding a blended fund you guarantee yourself the average of the small caps as a whole. When growth does well, you’ll benefit. When value does well, you’ll benefit. But if you bet on only value and it does poorly, you’ll suffer. I’ve heard small cap, low profitability, growth, has tended to reduce the size effect, but hasn’t value done that for the last decade? 

Since we cannot predict the future, we should seek to capture the average return of the stock market by holding the entire market. If we wish to take on added risk by overweighting certain parts of the market to increase our expected return, why not seek the average of those areas as well?

In general the legal wording make it difficult and time consuming to decipher

For example the latest tender offer from Ponos to owners of AT&amp;T (ticker: T) where it sounds like they are offering a premium of 20% ($36 compared to current price $30) but researching further I found below article clarifying that accepting the offer can only lead to loss because it will only take effect if the price is above $36 when it expires...

China is planning a sweeping set of new government policies to develop its domestic semiconductor industry and counter Trump administration restrictions, conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Beijing is preparing broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors for the five years through 2025, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing government deliberations. A suite of measures to bolster research, education and financing for the industry has been added to a draft of the country’s 14th five-year plan, which will be presented to the country’s top leaders in October, the people said.


China’s top leaders will gather next month to lay out their economic strategy for the next half decade, including efforts to ramp up domestic consumption and make critical technology at home. President Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to artificial intelligence. Semiconductors are fundamental to virtually every component of China’s technology ambitions -- and an increasingly aggressive Trump administration threatens to cut off their supply from abroad.

“The Chinese leadership realizes that semiconductors underpin all advanced technologies, and that it can no longer dependably rely on American supplies,” said Dan Wang, technology analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. “In the face of stricter U.S. restrictions on chip access, China’s response can only be to keep pushing its own industry to develop.”

A suite of measures to bolster research, education and financing for the industry has been added to a draft of the country’s 14th five-year plan, which will be presented to the country’s top leaders in October, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s top leaders will gather next month to lay out their economic strategy for the next half decade, including efforts to ramp up domestic consumption and make critical technology at home. President Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to artificial intelligence. Semiconductors are fundamental to virtually every component of China’s technology ambitions -- and an increasingly aggressive Trump administration threatens to cut off their supply from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Chinese leadership realizes that semiconductors underpin all advanced technologies, and that it can no longer dependably rely on American supplies,” said Dan Wang, technology analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. “In the face of stricter U.S. restrictions on chip access, China’s response can only be to keep pushing its own industry to develop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.........&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you see this affecting the semiconductor industry? Will China just buy their own chips or is this too ambitious?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMH and SOXX seem like most affected ETFs by this.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I am all for Apple devices and services. They make some of the best products ever. They have crazy high margins and once a consumer buys an Apple device, he has to buy other ones due to the seamless integration it provides (biggest selling point). It is now getting in more markets such as India with its' new iPhone SE 2, but I am somewhat skeptical on its' valuation.

I feel like people are buying AAPL due to its security - it has always gone up, so it will always go up - and therefore, it's safe to park their money there. Some are even likening it to Treasury Bonds - that it's better to put your money in AAPL stock because it's *safe* and because it's so big, it won't fail. 

I wanted to know if AAPL is overvalued/overpriced or not? I know the first 5G iPhone is coming out and it will have an impact but still, are people putting too much blind trust/faith in AAPL?

Stocks rose on Wednesday, continuing a strong start to September for the market as traders took profits out of high-flying names like Apple and Tesla and snapped up shares in more beaten-down parts of the market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 300 points, or 1%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1% while the Nasdaq Composite was higher by 0.5%. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, with the Nasdaq topping 12,000 for the first time. 

Coca-Cola rose more than 3% along with IBM to lead the Dow higher. However, both of those stocks are still down year to date. Apple and Tesla slid 2.6% and 6.5%, respectively, giving back some of their recently sharp gains. The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) rose 1.1% to outperform its Growth counterpart.

Wall Street was coming off a banner session in which the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 also logged in its best first trading day of September since 2010, according to Bespoke Investment Group. 

Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Mike Wilson said Tuesday on “[Closing Bell](https://www.cnbc.com/closing-bell/)” that he was still optimistic about the market long-term but that weakness in the weeks ahead was on the table after such a strong rally.

Ride-hailing firm Uber has stepped up lobbying of the Hong Kong government after losing a critical court case on the legality of its business model, with some drivers vowing to keep carrying passengers despite the threat of an intensified crackdown.
In a letter to stakeholders, legislators and other policymakers on Tuesday, Uber’s local head of public policy and government affairs called on them to use their influence to persuade the government to change its stance on the company.
“As we face this critical and uncertain period, I hope that we can continue to count on your support so that Uber and our partners can carry on serving the millions of Hongkongers who rely on our apps,” Richard Wilder said.
“There are different ways that individuals can support Uber at this point, either by raising the issue with relevant stakeholders as you see fit or by submitting to the chief executive’s policy address consultation directly.”

The plea came after the Court of Final Appeal on Tuesday threw out the last-ditch bids of 24 Uber drivers who were found guilty of carrying passengers for hire or reward without a hire-car permit, and were fined between HK$3,000 (US$380) and HK$4,500 in 2018.
The defeat was a devastating blow to Uber, which has provided millions of trips to residents since arriving in 2014, as well as delivering food orders.
“We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision, and we will continue to support the 24 partners and their families during this challenging time,” Wilder said.

The senior executive admitted the top court’s ruling, coupled with a lack of regulatory progress on ride-sharing in Hong Kong, had “profound consequences” for Uber and the 14,000 active drivers who hoped to find flexible earning opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic.

“We know that the single most common reason for becoming a driver-partner is to make up for lost income during the current economic crisis, with the second most important reason being the need to meet ongoing obligations to support their families,” Wilder said.

My portfolio lives and dies by the hand of Tesla but in any case I have been doing well maintaining liquidity and taking small wins on small positions daily bringing $50-150 on each short. Ive been doing my best to avoid getting too attached to anything even if I sell for profit and it continues up. I do not chase unless it is early in a rally. My goal is to consolidate as much capital and splurge on blue chips in the event of a crash. Rather then take calls or hedge with GOLD.

Chewy (CHWY) ; bought a $4.10/ 61.50 call for September 18th. Sold for 12.00   
\-This was an earnings play, based off the theory that ZM would push more of these ""Covid beneficiary"" stocks. Although they have nothing in common, pet sales sky-rocketed this spring, so online pet food sales were bound to follow.

SalesForce (CRM); bought a $5.90/270 call for September 11th. Sold for 14.30  
\-This was a momentum play, and one I do quite often. I had done a similar 300% trade last week, playing it off earnings. Healthy consolidation and bull volume keep this stock in a safe uptrend.

CrowdStrike (CRWD); I had bought two calls for this play, based on the pop Monday morning. Just like other Covid stocks, CRWD had momentum leading into its earnings date. Bought a $6.30/150 call for September 11th that I sold for $16.05. The other call is a long dated, out of the money, play that I will keep you updated on!

*The Fed now “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,” rather than 2% inflation as a fixed goal. What this means in practice is that:*

*“following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”*

When FED announced unlimited QE in mid-march, I didn't understand the implication of that and was still expecting for further market crash and reduced amount of my monthly investment. So would like to avoid the same mistake and analyze and discuss the implication of this major policy shift better.

Questions

1. Does this policy shift of allowing inflation higher than 2 % mean stocks are going to appreciate much more than expected before? Does this mean its prudent to invest now than wait for another corona related crash/Nov election crash?
2. What is the impact of this policy shift on other asset classes like bonds, metals etc compared to stocks?

The FDA inspected Mylan’s facility in Pashamylaram, India, in February.

The agency found that the plant, which makes active ingredients for drugs, hadn’t taken the proper precautions to ensure solvents it used didn’t contain impurities, including failing to adequately test the raw materials.

FDA inspectors reported that Mylan’s testing found signs of impurities in its solvents but that the company failed to investigate further.

Mylan said in a statement that it had been working with the FDA since last fall to thoroughly investigate potential risks associated with inquiries related to impurities.

It's clear that in markets that trend sideways with lots of volatility the end result is a net negative for levered ETFs.  It's usually argued that overtime this decay will gradually erode the value of the investment. However, back testing a levered version of the S&amp;P500 seems to show otherwise (assuming a 1% expense ratio):

The study that I'm sourcing here goes on the discuss relocating the investment elsewhere (treasuries or cash) in times where the underlying index is below the 200-day moving average (indicating higher than normal periods of volatility). By doing so they were able to reduce volatility and improve return.

Are you a risk-lover or are you risk-averse? Why does anyone take a risk in financial investments?

I have seen many day traders and investors proudly advertise themselves as ‘risk-takers’.

Is that really something to boast about? Not to throw shade on their profitable trading and investment strategies but why does anyone take risk?

Let’s say you want to grow your wealth. How would you do that?

A. Invest in your education / network and get a high-paying job.

B. Take a risk on your existing wealth to get a 10% return (profit) or a 5% loss (assuming a conservative risk-reward ratio of 1:2)

Option B is often touted as ‘passive income’ whereas Option A is touted as ‘Active income’ aka ‘hard-earned money’. Which one is the better option? Would you conserve your ‘hard-earned money’ or would you risk it to earn a little more pocket money?

,investing,"Based on sales and demand data from more than 17 million members and millions of items sold, the report charts the current state of luxury resale and COVID-19’s impact on what consumers are buying and selling.

Sales growth of high-value items, across numerous categories, outpaced that of low-value:

-**High-value jewelry sales grew 22x more than low-value**

-**High-value handbag sales grew 2.4x more than low-value**

-**High-value watch sales grew 6x more than low-value**

For the second year in a row, Gucci and Louis Vuitton remain the most in-demand brands within luxury resale. Louis Vuitton edged its way over Gucci for the No. 1 spot for the first time, while Gucci remains the No. 1 Men’s brand for the third year in a row. Driven by a surge in demand for millennials and Gen Z, both brands continued to strengthen their lead over No. 3 brand Chanel.

“In a bright spot during these difficult times, brands, shoppers and consignors alike are engaging in the circular economy,” said Rati Levesque, COO and head of merchandising for The RealReal. “Gen Z, millennials and men are the new faces of luxury shopping, and the brands in tune with what they want are rising to the top.”

Other trends that rose to the top during COVID-19*:

**Stealth luxury favored over logomania:**

-Demand for understated handbags was nearly 5x stronger than that of statement handbags

-Sales for quieter men’s styles grew 2.4x more than statement styles

**Buyers embrace luxury labels’ streetwear designs:**

-Balenciaga becomes No. 1 brand in streetwear

-Demand for luxury streetwear spiked 486 percent in the past two years

**Buyers and sellers turn to Home/Art like never before:**

-Art consignment was up 150%

-Customers spent 26 percent more on home items compared to apparel, quarter-over-quarter

As brick-and-mortar came to a standstill, brands and retailers turned to luxury resale to connect with buyers and give new life to pieces past and present – **interest increased 22x during COVID-19.**

-New consignors during COVID-19* increased 27 percent, of which 37 percent were **millennials and Gen Z.**

,investing,"I come to r/investing hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it. I understand my post isn’t is not the typical r/investing post, but my post is meant to hopefully explain some things the r/investing crowd may not have heavy exposure to, which is options and how they are having a massive effect on certain stocks, particularly Tesla. 

So to begin with, I see way too many posts like P/E of stock XYZ is too high. Tesla is one of these XYZ stocks, but the market has changed. No one really cares about P/E anymore. All that matters is supply and demand and especially through options. Unfortunately, because of retail, the entire options market has changed the last few months, which probably changed the behavior of funds too, causing the entire market to change. Here’s a quick explanation using some options terminology of what I see is happening. 

Call volume is almost like 90% today and it’s historically skewed towards calls, especially calls that put pressure on the upside skew of the vol curve (which brings in kurtosis). That’s the only thing that matters. If people buy calls -&gt; the stock will keep going up because it’s natural float is so low and big players like Musk and Baron don’t sell to cause any selling pressure. 

The equity game has changed to the point most people are now making their bullish bets through options to gain max leverage. If there are a lot of people buying calls, that’s a bullish sentiment and so the stock will go up, just like when people buy a lot of shares. People have to get that in their heads that supply/demand is what drives price moves and options provide a leveraged version of supply and demand. 

The calls on Tesla cause the name to explode even more to the upside than a boring name like say an INTC because Tesla comes with the extra special convexity/kurtosis bonus in that if the stock goes up, volatility explodes and gamma explodes. Hence market makers now will have to be desperate to buy as many shares as possible to stay delta neutral to the new skew, causing a feedback loop to bring the stock even higher.

This is also easier to do the lower the stock price, since calls become more affordable to retail. Whether that was Elon’s motivation for splitting the stock or not is unknown, but he’s a smart guy. I’m sure he probably knows.

It could theoretically work in reverse too, going down through the same short strikes it went through, but you would need a major catalyst. A major QQQ selloff or some announcement that’s bad for Elon Musk could trigger a -20% selloff since it does work in reverse, but in a natural market environment, this should not happen.

Simple STRATEGY: The strategy IMO is to buy SHARES. Buying puts is probably a no-no but you could get lucky once in a while with timing. Shorting shares is definitely a no-no unless you want to go bankrupt. Buying calls could be really good if you time it right, but the main issue with buying the calls is you have to buy it at the right vol level. Market makers are not just going to let you run them over, so they will naturally jack up this skew/call IV to a high level where they can win even selling calls and having the stock go up. For example, if Tesla is 490 now and a market maker sold a 600 call and delta hedged it by buying shares, they will win if the stock goes up to 600 even at expiration. The 600 call buyer would actually lose unless he sold earlier. Thus, shares is probably the better play. Nevertheless, the reason for these explosive up moves  is explained by options.

If you are uncomfortable with buying shares due to the high P/E and bubble like nature of Tesla, I can understand that. However, you must also understand investing should be more than a financial statement now. You must factor in things like options volume in terms of investing. Using the same mindset, this is why I would never ever invest in a stock like XOM. No retail is going in and buying XOM calls. This can be said about CSCO too. You don’t get that options pressure you want, which is a “fundamental” reason for a stock to go up. So if you don’t like Tesla since it is indeed a high P/E, you can apply this same idea and buy Apple (or Microsoft) then. It’s a lower and reasonable P/E, has similar call option volume flow, and is a much better long term investment than XOM or CSCO.",t2_7q5wojx4,False,,0,False,Tesla call volume will cause the stock to keep going up - as explained using some options terminology,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik3r8r,False,dark,0.8,,public,59,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,59,,False,,1598899494.0,,[],{},,True,,1598927854.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I come to &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;r/investing&lt;/a&gt; hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it.

,investing,"**Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment**

**Tl;dr FactSet is the most undervalued widespread SaaS/IT solution stock that exists**

If any of you have relevant experience or are friends with people in Investment Banking/other high finance, you know that Factset is the lifeblood of their financial analysis toolkit if and when it’s not Bloomberg, which isn’t even publicly traded. Factset has been around since *1978* and it’s considered a staple like Bloomberg in many wealth management firms, and it offers some of the easiest to access and understandable financial data so many newer firms focused less on trading are switching to Factset because it has a lot of the same data Bloomberg offers for half the cost. When it comes to modern financial data, Factset outcompetes Reuters and arguably Bloomberg as well due to their API services which makes Factset much more preferable for quantitative divisions of banks/hedge funds as API integration with Python/R is the most important factor for vast data lakes of financial data, this suggests Factset will be much more prepared for programming making its way into traditional finance fields. According to Factset, their mission for data delivery is to: “Integrate the data you need with your applications, web portals, and statistical packages. Whether you need [market](https://www.factset.com/products-data/market-data), [company](https://www.factset.com/products-data/core-company-data), or [alternative data](https://www.factset.com/products-data/alternative-data), FactSet flexible data delivery services give you normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our unique symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across your business. Build financial models and power customized applications with FactSet APIs in our [developer portal](https://developer.factset.com/)”. Their technical focus for their data delivery system alone should make it stand out compared to Bloomberg, whose UI is far more outdated and complex on top of not being as technically developed as Factset’s. Factset is the key provider of buy-side portfolio analysis for IBs, Hedge funds, and Private Equity firms, and it’s making its way into non-quantitative hedge funds as well because quantitative portfolio management makes automation of risk management and the application of portfolio theory so much easier, and to top it off, Factset’s scenario analysis and simulation is unique in its class. Factset also is able to automate trades based on individual manager risk tolerance and ML optimization for Forex trading as well. Not only does Factset provide solutions for financial companies, they are branching out to all corporations now and providing quantitative analytics for them in the areas of “corporate development, M&amp;A, strategy, treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations workflows”. Factset will eventually in my opinion reach out to Insurance Risk Management a lot more in the future as that’s a huge industry which has yet to see much automation of risk management yet, and with the field wide open, Factset will be the first to take advantage without a shadow of a doubt. So let’s dig into the company’s financials now:

Their latest 8k filing reported the following:

Revenue increased 2.6%, or $9.6 million, to $374.1 million compared with $364.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher sales of analytics, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions.

Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services was $1.52 billion at May 31, 2020, compared with $1.45 billion at May 31, 2019. The organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency movements, was 5.0%. The primary contributors to this growth rate were higher sales in FactSet's wealth and research workflow solutions and a price increase in the Company's international region

Adjusted operating margin improved to 35.5% compared with 34.0% in the prior year period primarily as a result of reduced employee-related operating expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 11.0% to $2.63 compared with $2.37 for the same period in fiscal 2019.

Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9.2% to $2.86 compared with $2.62 in the prior year period primarily driven by an improvement in operating results.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 15.0% compared with 18.6% a year ago, primarily due to an income tax expense in the prior year related to finalizing the Company's tax returns with no similar event for the three months ended May 31, 2020.

FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.

As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.

It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down

FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.

Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients' own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” ([https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link\_fullReport](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport)), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:

&amp;#x200B;

FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:

&amp;#x200B;

So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing *growth*. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of *32%* between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of *33%*

&amp;#x200B;

EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.

P/E has declined in the past 2 years, making it a great time to buy.

Increasing ROE despite lowering of leverage post 2016

&amp;#x200B;

Mountains of cash have been piling up in the coffers increasing chances of increased dividends for shareholders (imo dividend is too low right now, but increasing it will tempt more investors into it), and on top of that in the last 10k a large buyback expansion program was implemented for $210m worth of shares, which shows how confident they are in the company itself.

SGA expense/Gross profit has been declining despite expansion of offices

I’m a bit concerned about the skin in the game leadership has in this company, since very few executives/board members have significant holdings in the company, but the CEO himself is a FactSet veteran, and knows his way around the company. On top of that, Bloomberg remains king for trading and the fixed income security market, and Reuters beats out FactSet here as well. If FactSet really wants to increase cash flow sources, the expansion into insurance and corp dev has to be successful.

Summary: FactSet has a lot of growth still left in its industry which is already fast-growing in and of itself, and it only has more potential at its current valuation. Earnings September 24th should be a massive beat due to investment banking demand and growth plus Hedge fund requirements for data and portfolio management hasn’t gone anywhere and has likely increased due to more market opportunities to buy-in.",t2_4h8ltwha,False,,0,False,Factset DD,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikndfr,False,dark,0.55,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599006111.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr FactSet is the most undervalued widespread SaaS/IT solution stock that exists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you have relevant experience or are friends with people in Investment Banking/other high finance, you know that Factset is the lifeblood of their financial analysis toolkit if and when it’s not Bloomberg, which isn’t even publicly traded. Factset has been around since &lt;em&gt;1978&lt;/em&gt; and it’s considered a staple like Bloomberg in many wealth management firms, and it offers some of the easiest to access and understandable financial data so many newer firms focused less on trading are switching to Factset because it has a lot of the same data Bloomberg offers for half the cost. When it comes to modern financial data, Factset outcompetes Reuters and arguably Bloomberg as well due to their API services which makes Factset much more preferable for quantitative divisions of banks/hedge funds as API integration with Python/R is the most important factor for vast data lakes of financial data, this suggests Factset will be much more prepared for programming making its way into traditional finance fields. According to Factset, their mission for data delivery is to: “Integrate the data you need with your applications, web portals, and statistical packages. Whether you need &lt;a href=""https://www.factset.com/products-data/market-data""&gt;market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.factset.com/products-data/core-company-data""&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=""https://www.factset.com/products-data/alternative-data""&gt;alternative data&lt;/a&gt;, FactSet flexible data delivery services give you normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our unique symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across your business. Build financial models and power customized applications with FactSet APIs in our &lt;a href=""https://developer.factset.com/""&gt;developer portal&lt;/a&gt;”. Their technical focus for their data delivery system alone should make it stand out compared to Bloomberg, whose UI is far more outdated and complex on top of not being as technically developed as Factset’s. Factset is the key provider of buy-side portfolio analysis for IBs, Hedge funds, and Private Equity firms, and it’s making its way into non-quantitative hedge funds as well because quantitative portfolio management makes automation of risk management and the application of portfolio theory so much easier, and to top it off, Factset’s scenario analysis and simulation is unique in its class. Factset also is able to automate trades based on individual manager risk tolerance and ML optimization for Forex trading as well. Not only does Factset provide solutions for financial companies, they are branching out to all corporations now and providing quantitative analytics for them in the areas of “corporate development, M&amp;amp;A, strategy, treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations workflows”. Factset will eventually in my opinion reach out to Insurance Risk Management a lot more in the future as that’s a huge industry which has yet to see much automation of risk management yet, and with the field wide open, Factset will be the first to take advantage without a shadow of a doubt. So let’s dig into the company’s financials now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their latest 8k filing reported the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue increased 2.6%, or $9.6 million, to $374.1 million compared with $364.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher sales of analytics, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services was $1.52 billion at May 31, 2020, compared with $1.45 billion at May 31, 2019. The organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency movements, was 5.0%. The primary contributors to this growth rate were higher sales in FactSet&amp;#39;s wealth and research workflow solutions and a price increase in the Company&amp;#39;s international region&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusted operating margin improved to 35.5% compared with 34.0% in the prior year period primarily as a result of reduced employee-related operating expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 11.0% to $2.63 compared with $2.37 for the same period in fiscal 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9.2% to $2.86 compared with $2.62 in the prior year period primarily driven by an improvement in operating results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 15.0% compared with 18.6% a year ago, primarily due to an income tax expense in the prior year related to finalizing the Company&amp;#39;s tax returns with no similar event for the three months ended May 31, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients&amp;#39; own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” (&lt;a href=""https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport""&gt;https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport&lt;/a&gt;), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp""&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing &lt;em&gt;growth&lt;/em&gt;. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of &lt;em&gt;32%&lt;/em&gt; between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of &lt;em&gt;33%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"  

Today we’re going to talk about float, what it is and how you can build billion-dollar companies with it. Float is the money that a business receives today but doesn’t have to pay out until sometime in the future. Float is most commonly seen in insurance companies with customers paying premiums upfront to insure themselves against bad things happening sometime in the future. More examples include: Video game publishers, where they receive pre-orders. Commercial banking when they receive deposits and so on. 

Why is receiving money upfront so valuable even when it needs to be paid at later date? Well, you can invest it! And the longer you have to invest it, the more likely it will grow larger than the amount that you will have to eventually pay out! So, you can see how easily this can snowball. Say I owned a tiny insurance business that insured $1,000 worth of damages for a year in exchange for a $100 upfront payment. If I have $10,000 in the bank I can safely have say, five customers insured like this every year for $500. Every year I can invest the money I got from those new customers and every year the cash I have grows so I can safely insure more customers and the cash you have grows in an exponential manner. Ok cool got it. So, what does this have to do with Berkshire Hathaway?

Sometime around the mid-1960s Mr. Buffett realized, with the help of his friend Charlie Munger, that he can’t keep investing in broken down businesses and had to instead look for “franchise” business that will continue to compound his hard earned capital through thick and thin. The next thing he realized is that he couldn’t just rely on the free cash flow generated from those company’s and had to instead find low cost financing for his acquisitions. That low cost financing came in the form of an insurance float which, as we’ve seen, are the premiums paid by insurance customers up front in order to be paid out by the insurance company later. Buffett bought a ton of these insurance companies starting with National Indemnity in 1967

Wait, why did we just say that float is low cost financing? Why is it financing and what is the cost of that financing? Well, float is financing because you are receiving money today, but you have to pay it out sometime in the future, exactly like a loan. The beauty of float though is that you don’t have to pay interest on that money! The only “interest” that you have to pay on that money is the normal cost of operating your business.

We’ve already seen why float would matter so much to Buffett, but it bears repeating.  A dollar you receive today is worth more than a dollar you get a week from now because you can invest it at some rate to receive more money in the future. Buffet realized that the more float he had, the more float he could invest to buy other businesses. Float would compound in lockstep with the free-cashflow generated by his other businesses and in time create a juggernaut.

The final step in the Berkshire secret formula was increasing the duration of time between when the premiums are received and when they’re paid out. So, for Buffett, this meant buying up longer tailed insurance companies like insurance for catastrophes, and recently, Reinsurance companies.  And there you have it! This is the basic DNA of one the most successful stocks in over the past 50 years and they’re still going at it.",t2_7whqrqof,False,,0,False,Berkshire Hathaway and the incredible power of float,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ijnr09,False,dark,0.95,,public,1095,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1095,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598861638.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to talk about float, what it is and how you can build billion-dollar companies with it.

And the longer you have to invest it, the more likely it will grow larger than the amount that you will have to eventually pay out! So, you can see how easily this can snowball. Say I owned a tiny insurance business that insured $1,000 worth of damages for a year in exchange for a $100 upfront payment. If I have $10,000 in the bank I can safely have say, five customers insured like this every year for $500. Every year I can invest the money I got from those new customers and every year the cash I have grows so I can safely insure more customers and the cash you have grows in an exponential manner. Ok cool got it. So, what does this have to do with Berkshire Hathaway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime around the mid-1960s Mr. Buffett realized, with the help of his friend Charlie Munger, that he can’t keep investing in broken down businesses and had to instead look for “franchise” business that will continue to compound his hard earned capital through thick and thin. The next thing he realized is that he couldn’t just rely on the free cash flow generated from those company’s and had to instead find low cost financing for his acquisitions. That low cost financing came in the form of an insurance float which, as we’ve seen, are the premiums paid by insurance customers up front in order to be paid out by the insurance company later. Buffett bought a ton of these insurance companies starting with National Indemnity in 1967&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, why did we just say that float is low cost financing? Why is it financing and what is the cost of that financing? Well, float is financing because you are receiving money today, but you have to pay it out sometime in the future, exactly like a loan. The beauty of float though is that you don’t have to pay interest on that money! The only “interest” that you have to pay on that money is the normal cost of operating your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen why float would matter so much to Buffett, but it bears repeating.  A dollar you receive today is worth more than a dollar you get a week from now because you can invest it at some rate to receive more money in the future. Buffet realized that the more float he had, the more float he could invest to buy other businesses. Float would compound in lockstep with the free-cashflow generated by his other businesses and in time create a juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step in the Berkshire secret formula was increasing the duration of time between when the premiums are received and when they’re paid out. So, for Buffett, this meant buying up longer tailed insurance companies like insurance for catastrophes, and recently, Reinsurance companies.  And there you have it! This is the basic DNA of one the most successful stocks in over the past 50 years and they’re still going at it.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Securities fraud class action brought on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired VXRT securities during the Class Period – between June 25, 2020 and July 20, 2020, inclusive. The case seeks to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

Vaxart is a clinical-stage Company purportedly engaged in the discovery and development of vaccines for a variety of diseases that would be administered orally, rather than by injection.

The class action arises from Defendants’ alleged fraudulent scheme to profit from artificially inflating the Company’s stock price by announcing false and misleading information concerning Vaxart’s oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on June 26, 2020, Vaxart issued a press release entitled, “Vaxart’s COVID-19 Vaccine Selected for the U.S. Government’s Operation Warp Speed,” falsely claiming its vaccine had been selected to participate in a non-human challenge study, organized and funded by OWS.  This announcement sent the price of Vaxart shares rocketing higher.

In furtherance of the scheme, Defendants amended controlling shareholder Armistice’s existing warrant agreements, allowing Armistice to exercise all of its warrants immediately and sell 27.6 million Vaxart shares, reaping profits of approximately $200 million.  Defendants also issued millions of dollars in favorable stock options to Vaxart’s most senior executives.

The Complaint alleges that on July 25, 2020, details emerged revealing Defendants’ deception concerning their alleged pump and dump scheme. In particular, on July 25, 2020, The New York Times published an article entitled, “Corporate Insiders Pocket $1 Billion in Rush for Coronavirus Vaccine,” covering suspiciously timed stock bets that had generated significant profits for senior executives and board members at companies developing vaccines and treatments. Vaxart was featured prominently in the article, and it clarified “Vaxart is not among the companies selected to receive significant financial support from Warp Speed.” In response to this news, the price of Vaxart shares dropped sharply lower on July 27, 2020 from $12.29 to $11.16.

I’m new to investing and before today I had never tried to log into my account when the market has just opened. 

Today though, due to the stock split with Apple, I am trying to log in on both app and desktop and the site is super slow and keeps giving me error messages when I log in.

What seems most obvious is that Vanguard is crashing because everyone is trying to log into their accounts all at once, maybe because of Apple’s stock split.

However I wonder, is this just normal behavior this early when the market is just opening?

Do not do what I did and hit submit payment 100 times hoping to get a confirmation. It says my account has way more now than I intended and that is even in my checking account.

,investing,"On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players. This follows several other media reports over the last few years (CNBC, WSJ) that AT&amp;T has been considering selling its DirecTV business, as well as comments by DISH management that a combination of Dish's satellite operations with DirecTV are inevitable.

Goldman issued the following report this morning outlining some interesting thoughts:

**Why would AT&amp;T sell DirecTV? Three potential objectives:**

1. **Streamlining AT&amp;T's operations to focus on mobile, broadband and streaming entertainment.** AT&amp;T is the most diversified company in the US communications and media sector. While this diversification has the potential to yield certain competitive advantages, such as AT&amp;T's bundles of wireless and broadband connectivity with its streaming video services such as HBO Max, we believe it has also created a degree of operational complexity. This is especially the case, in our view, for the DirecTV satellite TV service, which is experiencing significant structural headwinds owing to industry-wide cord-cutting that is not only resulting in customer losses, but reducing the appeal of the service in AT&amp;T's product bundles.

With AT&amp;T having already made its flagship HBO Max streaming service available to its DirecTV customers, we believe the company has now captured the majority of the product and cost synergies from this asset. As such AT&amp;T may view that it can be a more focused and nimble competitor in its core mobile, broadband and streaming markets by divesting control of its satellite TV operations in the US. Indeed, separating from AT&amp;T could also allow DirecTV to operate in a structure that works better for a mature cash-generative business, which could benefit AT&amp;T to the extent it retained a stake in the company.

2) **Accelerate AT&amp;T's balance sheet deleveraging.** Since completing the acquisition of Time Warner in 2018, AT&amp;T has reduced it net debt by $25 billion from $177 billion to $152 billion as of 2Q20 through a combination of strong FCF, asset sales and other asset monetizations. While this has lowered its net debt/EBITDA from 3.3x to 2.7x, the company remains well above its historical leverage in the low-2x range, which we believe remains its long-term target. As such, we believe that AT&amp;T could likely consider any transaction that enabled it to accelerate its delevering by pulling forward value for non-core assets. Even if a transaction were only modestly delevering, in terms of its net leverage ratio, we believe that simply lowering the gross dollar amount of outstanding debt could improve AT&amp;T's financial flexibility by making it less reliant on the investment grade credit markets during a period of significant economic uncertainty.

3) **Achieve further cost efficiencies and synergies.** This opportunity would likely only apply to a combination with another pay-TV operator (vs. a financial buyer) owing to significant overlapping costs. We have not attempted to estimate synergies from this type of hypothetical combination, but AT&amp;T's own combination of DirecTV with its U-verse business in 2015 could be a potential precedent.

That merger represented the combination of DirecTV's base of 20 million US satellite TV subscribers with AT&amp;T's base of 6 million landline U-verse video subscribers. While these services were based on different infrastructure, the company initially estimated cost synergies would exceed $1.6 billion on an annual run rate basis by year-three after closing. One year later, AT&amp;T increased this target to $2.5 billion, based on lower programming costs across the combined video operations (DirecTV + U-verse) with other savings from core operational functions (e.g., truck rolls, billing, customer care, advertising, etc.).

**A combination with Dish could face regulatory scrutiny.**

For details on the potential regulatory considerations facing a potential merger of DirecTV and Dish, please see takeaways from our discussion with Andrew Lipman, partner at law firm Morgan Lewis, at the 28th Annual Communacopia conference in 2019. Here is our summary of Mr. Lipman's comments, which you can find in the report cited above:

Mr. Lipman believes that Dish and DirecTV could potentially get a deal through federal regulatory authorities if there was a will from both companies to merge. This is despite the failure of a similar proposal to merge between the two satellite operators in 2002. He believes that the pay-TV market has changed drastically since the original merger attempt (i.e. fiber and cable presence in rural areas, OTT offerings). Mr. Lipman believes that such a deal could potentially be structured in different ways to address the government's likely concerns that rural areas could be hurt by this merger including 1) price freezes or 2) allowing the two companies to combine back office functions, prior to a potential full merger.

**What impact would a sale of DirecTV have on the pay-TV market?**

We do not believe that a partial sale of DirecTV to financial partners, or any entity which would continue to operate DirecTV as an independent satellite TV operator, would have a material impact on the pay-TV market. This is because such a hypothetical transaction would not significantly impact the number of competitors. To some extent, it could yield a modest increase in competition as DirecTV would now compete directly with AT&amp;T's other pay-TV services, including its new Internet-based service AT&amp;T TV. However, we do not see this as a material change in the overall competitive backdrop.

A theoretical combination of DirecTV with Dish would represent a merger of the 2nd (DirecTV) and 4th (Dish) largest pay-TV providers in the US, resulting in a new company with over 25 million video customers (as of 2019), ranking it ahead of the current #1 Comcast (21.2 million). As such, a merger of the US's two satellite TV operators could lower competition among traditional facilities-based pay-TV providers. However, as we detailed in our recent initiation report on the US media sector, traditional pay-TV services are already experiencing material subscriber losses owing to competition from new streaming services. The pressures on satellite TV providers have been particularly intense, with the combined customer bases of DirecTV and Dish declining by 13% in 2019 vs. video subscriber declines of approximately 3% for the major cable providers. As such, a theoretical combination of these companies could potentially enable them to generate synergies that position them to remain viable competitors in the pay-TV sector longer than if they remained independent.

**What is DirecTV's financial contribution to AT&amp;T**

AT&amp;T does not report any financial or operating metrics for its DirecTV satellite TV operations. This business is included within the company's Entertainment Group segment, which in 2019 generated $45 billion of revenue (25% of consolidated revenue) and $10 billion in EBITDA (17% of consolidated EBITDA). Below, we provide our rough estimates for the size of the DirecTV subscriber base and its contributions to AT&amp;T's revenue and EBITDA in 2019. These estimates are intended to be illustrative in order to provide context for the scale of DirecTV within AT&amp;T's consolidated operations and relative to peers in the pay-TV sector.

**We estimate that AT&amp;T ended 2019 with approximately 16 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers**, out of 19.5 million total Premium TV subscribers. As of YE2018, when AT&amp;T last disclosed the mix of it Premium TV subscriber base, the company had 19.2 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers and 3.7 million U-verse video subscribers. In 2019, the company's combined Premium TV subscriber base declined 15%, which we believe was primarily driven by losses of DirecTV customers owing to the end of promotional pricing. For context, the large cable operators, whose video + broadband service bundles are more comparable to the U-verse offerings, saw their video subscriber bases decline by approximately 3% in 2019. If we assume the same trend played-out with U-verse, then that implies the DirecTV subscriber base declined 17% in 2019.

For context, this implies that DirecTV ended 2019 roughly tied with Charter (16.1 million video subscribers) as the second largest pay-TV service in the US. This compares to Comcast's video subscriber base of 21.2 million and Dish's satellite TV subscriber base of 9.4 million.

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $25 billion of revenue in 2019**. We arrive at this estimate by assuming that ARPU for DirecTV subscribers is comparable to AT&amp;T's reported Premium TV ARPU in 2019 of $121. This implies that in 2019 the DirecTV satellite TV service contributed 57% of Entertainment Group revenue (14% of consolidated).

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $7 billion of EBITDA in 2019**. This estimate implies an EBITDA margin in the mid/high 20%s. We believe this is a reasonable rough estimate based on few factors. First, DirecTV's closest peer, Dish, operates with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. Based on AT&amp;T's scale in video vs. Dish, we estimate that its average monthly programming costs per Premium TV subscriber is approximately $5 lower than DISH's. This estimated cost advantage represents approximately 4-percentage points of margin benefit for DirecTV vs. this peer.

Second, we assume additional scale benefits in SG&amp;A. For context, when AT&amp;T acquired DirecTV in 2015, its US satellite TV operations generated an EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. While we estimate that the DirecTV subscriber base in the US has declined by over 20% since the acquisition, we also estimate that AT&amp;T has increased the service's ARPU by over 10% and generated cost synergies, which management previously estimated would reach a run-rate of $2.5 billion. We therefore believe it is reasonable to estimate that margins have remained at least flat, and likely improved, since the acquisition of DirecTV, despite material subscriber losses.

Our approximate estimate for DirecTV's EBITDA implies that in 2019 it contributed nearly 70% of Entertainment Group EBITDA (12% of consolidated).",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$T - thoughts on the potential sale of DirecTV,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik5l65,False,dark,0.74,,public,16,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598933533.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players.

 With the work from home model becoming increasingly engrained in every day life, it's no wonder more people are putting in efforts to better their living conditions. Sales from home improvement retail stores like Home Depot surged in the spring, and continue to level off near term. With these tail winds comes a respective demand for homes. Home sales were up 15.5% (YoY) in July as mortgage rates continue to parallel the ""low interest rate"" environment, sliding below 3%. Re-financing was a viable option for many, and will continue to be an outlet for people to free up cash flow.  


 **The 10YR Treasury (TNX)**  has broken out in the last few days, topping .75, the highest since mid-June. A weak dollar and political unrest impacting our next stimulus could cause the 10YR note to rise to the .8 level, where if it breaks out, the market will prohibit multiple expansion. As market makers continue to buy the underlying assets on calls, numbers show that 75% of the volume is for contracts expiring in the next two weeks.   


**Limbach Holdings (LMB)** has bounced over 250% from its March low of $2.37, attracting more and more retail investors.

**Goldman (Neutral rating, $295 price target) comments on today's announcement of $5bn equity raise:**

""We believe key points to help contextualize this news includes:

1) $5 bn of equity issuance would represent about 1% incremental shares based on the 8/31/2020 close.

2) The prospectus states that the use of proceeds would be to further strengthen the balance sheet, and for general corporate purposes.

3) Tesla has a history of issuing equity, but unlike this proposed offering Tesla has typically announced offerings on the day it filed or within a few weeks of filing its 10-Q/10-K. Further, while the company commented on its 4Q19 EPS call that it was not capital constrained, investing as fast as it sensibly could and generating positive cash flow, Tesla has also raised capital post making those comments (the company last issued new equity in February 2020). Finally, the company has capacity expansion plans underway at several factories, and per its last 10-K Tesla expects average annual capex to be $2.5-$3.5 bn from 2020-2022.

,investing,"I've seen lots of conflicting answers to the question ""I want to put $ in stocks for [x] years.""  Most agree that buying stocks for a shorter horizon than 5 years (for house down payment, etc.) is a bad idea.  Beyond that though, you see some people saying 7, 10, or 15 years is safe.

I'm not going to say I know for sure what is optimal, but what I can do is provide some actual numbers.  While past returns are no guarantee of future returns, on a large enough timescale we can at least build a decent model.  I looked at the past **90 years of total returns** for the S&amp;P 500 (including dividends), Baa corporate bonds, US T-bonds, and 3-month T-bills.

I calculated rolling total return for various holding periods across the entire range.  I then compared them to each other to see how often the stocks had a negative return, and how often they were outperformed by the various bond classes.

[Here are the results.](https://i.imgur.com/YGHcOi1.png)

While I wouldn't draw any **strong** conclusions from this, it certainly casts a lot of doubt on people advising that 7 or 10 years is adequate for 100% equity when you have about a 27-34% chance of losing to bonds.  On the other end of the spectrum, this paints many target date funds as overly conservative, for example the [Vanguard 2045 fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtivx) holds about 10% bonds even though they have about half that chance of beating stocks.

I expect these numbers may be quite surprising to some people, especially since the past decade has been a generous bull market that makes equities look invincible.  Anyway, if anybody has other quantitative means of looking at this, please share.  Happy investing!

&lt;p&gt;I calculated rolling total return for various holding periods across the entire range.  I then compared them to each other to see how often the stocks had a negative return, and how often they were outperformed by the various bond classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/YGHcOi1.png""&gt;Here are the results.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I wouldn&amp;#39;t draw any &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; conclusions from this, it certainly casts a lot of doubt on people advising that 7 or 10 years is adequate for 100% equity when you have about a 27-34% chance of losing to bonds.  On the other end of the spectrum, this paints many target date funds as overly conservative, for example the &lt;a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtivx""&gt;Vanguard 2045 fund&lt;/a&gt; holds about 10% bonds even though they have about half that chance of beating stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect these numbers may be quite surprising to some people, especially since the past decade has been a generous bull market that makes equities look invincible.  Anyway, if anybody has other quantitative means of looking at this, please share.  Happy investing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Based on some comments I don&amp;#39;t think I communicated this clearly, but it&amp;#39;s more about how to evaluate asset allocation based on how far you are from horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Seeing the recent rapid rise of the market and some stock went skyrocketed, I am curious about what would the academia think on the phenomenon, So I looked for research papers that were published on journals and would like to share this particular paper on 'bubble' with you all.

The paper [bubble for fama](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v131y2019i1p20-43.html) is written by Greenwood, Robin, Shleifer, Andrei and You, Yang and was published in the Journal of Financial Economics, one of the most eminent financial journal. They aimed to evaluate the saying from Eugene Fama, 2013 Nobel laureate in economic sciences. Who once said in 2016 ""For bubbles, I want a systematic way of identifying them. It’s a simple proposition. You have to be able to predict that there is some end to it. All the tests people have done trying to do that don’t work. Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles.""  Here are what the authors of the paper have done.

First of all, they put their focus on industries instead of individual stocks. A major reason for this is bubbles, by nature is very hard to define, using industry as a unit ensure the same phenomenon is experienced by the same enough firms. (Imagine a penny stock that can go up by 100% then drop in an hour, is it very hard to define if it is a bubble for statistical analysis). Researchers defined an industry is experiencing a 'price runs up' if the return for the past 2 years is over 100%, and define a bubble burst to be over 40% drops in the following 2 years after the peak. 

Using data from 1928 to 2014. Researchers have identified 40 'runs up' in the US stock market. And they realise the Eugene Fama is mostly right in the sense that you couldn't tell if a price run-up will be followed by a burst of not. In the 40 episodes, 21 of them experienced an over 40% crash while the other 19 episodes didn't. So you cannot say something is in a bubble just because their price has gone up by a lot. And the average time needed for the bubble episodes to reach the peaks varies from 0 months to 17 months. So it would be against the stat if you were to short sell a rapid raising industry, not only you would be proven wrong about half the time, you also need to have extreme deep pocket combined with a lot of patients to win the battle. For episodes that indeed crashed, on average they will return to the market level, and generally speaking, the market is always rising given long enough time. The implication here is even if you buy in a bubble industry, you might still retain some gains after the bubble burst (most likely to be beaten by the market tho).

However, there's more to come. The researchers further study who's the differences between the crashing episodes and the non-crashing episodes. They found that there are some characteristics that distinguish crashing and non-crashing, all with p-value &lt; 10% (That is they have 1/10 chances their statistical significance is happened by chance). They are: 

1. 1-year change in volatility (Volatility from year T-1 to now, minus volatility from year T-2 to year T-1). On average the volatility change is positive for crashed episodes and slightly negative for non-crash episodes.
2. firm age. Crashed episodes are on average 15 percentile rank younger than non-crashed episodes.
3. age tilt (to capture whether the price run-up occurred disproportionately among the younger firms in the industry). Crashed episodes' price run-up has a higher concentration in younger firms.
4. Percentage of Issuers ( percentage of firms in the industry which issued new shares within the last two years) Crashed episodes have a higher percentage of issuers.
5. Acceleration (Difference between 2 years return to (year T-2 to year T-1 return) Crashed episodes have a higher acceleration. Around 30% higher in fact.

Then the researchers asked, can these characteristics predict the coming 2 years return for the 40 episodes identified? The answer is yes and no. After going through some statistic measure and control for market return. None of these characteristics can predict future returns with satisfactory statistical power. However, if we don't control for market return, all of the above can predict a lower return within the coming 24 months. And on the [online appendix](http://docplayer.net/136929952-Internet-appendix-with-supplement-results-for-bubbles-for-fama-robin-greenwood-andrei-shleifer-and-yang-you-last-updated-sep.html) , they also show using these characteristics as signal to avoid bubble can boost the return to 10% more compared with the benchmark index.

TLDR: 

\-You can't say something is a bubble just because its price goes up rapidly

\-However, there are variables that can help you the identify potential bubbles

\-And you can boost your return by avoiding to trade the bubble",t2_1q2o9ywj,False,,0,False,Financial Literature Sharing: Bubble For Fama,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikhgpf,False,dark,0.4,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598982969.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the recent rapid rise of the market and some stock went skyrocketed, I am curious about what would the academia think on the phenomenon, So I looked for research papers that were published on journals and would like to share this particular paper on &amp;#39;bubble&amp;#39; with you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper &lt;a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v131y2019i1p20-43.html""&gt;bubble for fama&lt;/a&gt; is written by Greenwood, Robin, Shleifer, Andrei and You, Yang and was published in the Journal of Financial Economics, one of the most eminent financial journal. They aimed to evaluate the saying from Eugene Fama, 2013 Nobel laureate in economic sciences. Who once said in 2016 &amp;quot;For bubbles, I want a systematic way of identifying them. It’s a simple proposition. You have to be able to predict that there is some end to it. All the tests people have done trying to do that don’t work. Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles.&amp;quot;  Here are what the authors of the paper have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, they put their focus on industries instead of individual stocks. A major reason for this is bubbles, by nature is very hard to define, using industry as a unit ensure the same phenomenon is experienced by the same enough firms. (Imagine a penny stock that can go up by 100% then drop in an hour, is it very hard to define if it is a bubble for statistical analysis). Researchers defined an industry is experiencing a &amp;#39;price runs up&amp;#39; if the return for the past 2 years is over 100%, and define a bubble burst to be over 40% drops in the following 2 years after the peak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data from 1928 to 2014. Researchers have identified 40 &amp;#39;runs up&amp;#39; in the US stock market. And they realise the Eugene Fama is mostly right in the sense that you couldn&amp;#39;t tell if a price run-up will be followed by a burst of not. In the 40 episodes, 21 of them experienced an over 40% crash while the other 19 episodes didn&amp;#39;t. So you cannot say something is in a bubble just because their price has gone up by a lot. And the average time needed for the bubble episodes to reach the peaks varies from 0 months to 17 months. So it would be against the stat if you were to short sell a rapid raising industry, not only you would be proven wrong about half the time, you also need to have extreme deep pocket combined with a lot of patients to win the battle. For episodes that indeed crashed, on average they will return to the market level, and generally speaking, the market is always rising given long enough time. The implication here is even if you buy in a bubble industry, you might still retain some gains after the bubble burst (most likely to be beaten by the market tho).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s more to come. The researchers further study who&amp;#39;s the differences between the crashing episodes and the non-crashing episodes. They found that there are some characteristics that distinguish crashing and non-crashing, all with p-value &amp;lt; 10% (That is they have 1/10 chances their statistical significance is happened by chance). They are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-year change in volatility (Volatility from year T-1 to now, minus volatility from year T-2 to year T-1). On average the volatility change is positive for crashed episodes and slightly negative for non-crash episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;firm age. Crashed episodes are on average 15 percentile rank younger than non-crashed episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;age tilt (to capture whether the price run-up occurred disproportionately among the younger firms in the industry). Crashed episodes&amp;#39; price run-up has a higher concentration in younger firms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage of Issuers ( percentage of firms in the industry which issued new shares within the last two years) Crashed episodes have a higher percentage of issuers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acceleration (Difference between 2 years return to (year T-2 to year T-1 return) Crashed episodes have a higher acceleration. Around 30% higher in fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers asked, can these characteristics predict the coming 2 years return for the 40 episodes identified? The answer is yes and no. After going through some statistic measure and control for market return. None of these characteristics can predict future returns with satisfactory statistical power. However, if we don&amp;#39;t control for market return, all of the above can predict a lower return within the coming 24 months. And on the &lt;a href=""http://docplayer.net/136929952-Internet-appendix-with-supplement-results-for-bubbles-for-fama-robin-greenwood-andrei-shleifer-and-yang-you-last-updated-sep.html""&gt;online appendix&lt;/a&gt; , they also show using these characteristics as signal to avoid bubble can boost the return to 10% more compared with the benchmark index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the paper&amp;#39;s focus is on the industry level, but I believe the discovery is linked with strong behavioural/economics explanation and is applicable to individual stocks. One thing I forgot to mention above is that almost all the bubbles happened in a bull market. Reading this paper reminds me of today&amp;#39;s market. I am still a student and relatively new to the investing world. English isn&amp;#39;t my first language so apologies if there are places that isn&amp;#39;t clear enough. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-You can&amp;#39;t say something is a bubble just because its price goes up rapidly&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from the SEC filing, Linus provides some perspective as someone who is very well-versed with Corsair

Pros
Dominant position in the industry
Brand loyalty and established business


Cons
Have been making losses before 2020
Limited room for growth beyond the position they are in
If COVID-19 drags on, they will continue to do well, and even after the pandemic some people may end up buying equipment for home use in the LR.
Questionable acquisition of OriginPC
Does not own any factories

Conclusion:
Luke says short due to volatility and hype in the short term, long in the long term.

Linus would ""not buy the stock at all"", due to his belief of the company's potential, and he thinks that he average investor wouldn't buy the hype around rgb peripherals.

,investing,"  

Sitting atop a cash pile of over $100 billion dollars, Warren Buffet is often asked why Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend. The standard answer for the past thirty or forty years has been that Berkshire’s cash pile would be better spent on either acquisitions or share buybacks. While there is certainly truth to this statement, there is a bigger reason for the lack of a Berkshire yield.

Warren Buffett personally owns approximately 250,000 shares of Class A Berkshire stock. Often Buffett has been quoted as saying he has “never sold a share of Berkshire Hathaway.” If this is true, that would indicate that in the process of building up his multi-billion-dollar fortune, Buffett has never paid any income taxes on his Berkshire shares. Assuming Buffett does not, or has not, ever personally sold any Berkshire shares, that would mean he is not only a savvy investor but also the undisputed master of the unrealized gain. 

Warren has often said he draws a yearly salary of $100,000 from Berkshire Hathaway. Assuming his Berkshire salary is accurate and he has little else for additional income coming in, it is likely that Buffett (a multi-billionaire) pays nearly the same amount of income taxes as you or I. A Berkshire dividend would be exceptionally detrimental to Buffett’s income tax bill. A quick calculation to demonstrate:

(all numbers very approximate for demonstration purposes)

Number of “A” shares owned by Buffett: 250,000

A 5% yield on Berkshire “A” shares for 1 year would yield (for Buffett) approximately: $4,087,500,000

A 20% capital gain tax on his dividend would result in a personal tax bill of approximately: $817,500,000

With Berkshire paying a 5% yield, not only would Buffett end up with a near $1 billion tax bill, he would also have to find a place to invest nearly $3 billion of his after-tax dividend income (every year). This clearly demonstrates why he prefers share buybacks over dividend payouts.

Buffett is a multi-billionaire and he certainly did not get there by accident. As a result of (arguably) the greatest (legal) tax avoidance scheme in the history of modern American business, Buffett has painted himself into a corner when it comes to the payment of a Berkshire dividend. Berkshire investors can pretty near be guaranteed Berkshire Hathaway will never pay a divided as long as Buffett is alive and holding his shares.

,investing,"Serious, I'd like to hear from you what you think is the marker of a market wide correction... or a crash to come.   Personally, I really thought the AAPL TSLA stock split was it.  I expected a correction across most of NASDAQ today.   The valuation run up after the split-announcement and before the actual split (today) was incredible... and IMHO... unwarranted.  I predicted (incorrectly) that profiteers were looking to sell off after the split and there could be a considerable sell off today.  I thought the fact that today was the last day of the month might be a catalyst of a sell off.  Perhaps ETF and Mutual Fund adjustments resulted in pulling AAPL and TSLA up, not down.  
I'm not a bear, or bearish.  I'm holding these because I felt they both have legs for the long run but the recent run up has me nervous and I believe large sectors are oversold (starting with FAANG, including all EVs).  


I'm a private investor.  A day trader (more of a week trader) of sorts.  I'm diversified.  I don't need advice on what to buy, or sell.  I'm more interested in discussing the next large swing of the market.  
Looking forward, unemployment is up but hasn't taken hold of the markets yet.  Unemployment benefits were chopped in half.   15MM+ renters are behind in rent.  Consumer spending is at an all time low.  I know I know the stocks going up don't depend (directly) on consumer spending but where does FAANG stop?  I predicted 10% above Feb 1, 2020 values was the ceiling.  We are well beyond that.  


I'll offer my prediction in exchange for yours.  I have no tacit data to support my thinking but here it is.  FAANG will get a correction somewhere along the line.  Not a crash.  Maybe a 10-15% drop from ATH.  That correction will stop this bull run and with everyone declaring tech as 'oversold' FAANG et all will hang at a stagnant value into perpetuity.   I offer MSFT from 2001 to 2012 as an example.   After the tech-crash of 2001, MSFT was 'stuck' at $35 for over 10 years.   10 years of steady improvements in customer base, product diversity, and increasing revenues but investors couldn't seem to care.  


Retail investors (who all suffer from ADD) will flock to other sectors while waiting for the next tech-bull-run to start.  It will be hard to start if MSFT, AAPL, GOOG can't sustain growth of cloud and retail sales.  But the customers (business and private customers) who buy these products will cool off as they themselves struggle with reduced revenues (see consumer spending).  It's election time and FB and others are enjoying increased ad revenue that will vaporize in Nov.  


But when?  Man... I don't know.  Assuming this run is caused by retail investors, perhaps the harbinger will be the fund managers who declare 'enough' and boldly exit.

,investing,"So I know that bonds decrease in value when interest rates rise (because you could get higher returns on newly issued bonds). But isn't this ""decrease in bond value"" only relative to the second market? I.e, this ""decreased bond value"" is only important in the context of other investors wanting to buy/sell bonds to one another?

So if you have a bond with 2% interest rate yield, but the interest rates are now 3%, obviously you aren't getting the maximum possible return, but as your interest rate returns are still the same, regardless of how the second market values your lower interest bond, you're still getting a profit-- albeit it just being less than the maximum possible, correct?

So my question is, is the decreasing value of your bond in the secondary market when interest rates increase only significant if you're looking to make the most profit/buy the most profitable type of bond available?

Simplifying the picture, is it safe to assume one is ""greedy"" (simplifying desires for greater profit margins) for worrying about increased interest rates and thus the (declining) value of the associated bond, as in the end you still get back your bond equity + original 2% interest rate?

Also, if the interest rate is increasing, for the long term, doesn't that mean inflation will (at the very least) slow down?

My understanding is that ETFs are generally considered to be more tax-efficient and the better choice, but most articles that say this are saying so in comparison to actively managed mutual funds.

However, if an index fund is *passively* managed (ex. FXAIX), then would it not also trigger very few capital gains, therefore making it effectively the same in terms of tax benefits as compared to an ETF like SPY? I know that the expense ratios differ, but as someone who finds tax filings to be very confusing, my main concern is dealing with the tax implications of these choices.

If it were up to me, I would prefer to invest in an index fund like FXAIX in my taxable account so that I don't have to purchase whole shares of SPY, but if SPY triggers less capital gains then I'd obviously prefer to go with that.

,investing,"So after the bullish week NIO had last week, they decided to make an offering of 75mm shares. Since the price tanked, they decided to make a second offering to rise the goal of 1.5 billions... Just months after they secured funding from the chinese goverment for that same amount of dollars.

Many seem to believe the offering is well placed due to the run and because they wanted to increase their ownership from around 70 to 80 something percent.

From a shareholders perspective, this seems to be a very dodgy move. I believe this is more about greed than anything else by the company's management. 70-80% ownership does not have any meaningful value since they already have the majority of the company's ownership.

In any case, we will see how the market reacts (already down 5% in pre market). And as a typical case of dodgy moves by the chinese, I consider this a risky bet at this price range. I am setting a stop-loss at 16.5 level and might reenter the stock at a latter date.

&gt;	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Herbalife Nutrition Ltd will pay $123.1 million to settle criminal and civil charges it bribed Chinese officials in government agencies and media outlets to boost its business in China, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday.

&gt;The multi-level marketing company, whose products include dietary supplements, entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement in which it admitted to conspiring to violate the books and records provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law.

&gt;Authorities said Herbalife schemed from 2007 to 2016 to bribe Chinese officials with cash, entertainment, meals and travel to obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media.

&gt;China accounted for 19% of Herbalife’s $4.49 billion of net sales in 2016, up from 7% in 2006, regulatory filings show.

,investing,"Hello guys and gals,

So i have been a longtime lurker on this sub-reddit since I started my investing journey in early 2018. I wanted to get input on how one would go about pricing a stock that is not traded on any financial market. Rather, the stock is purchased from directly from known buyers. The thing is that you would have to first figure out who owns the stock through an ad or simply asking around.

The company first sold its shares at 10$ a piece in 2004. Fast forward 16 years later, and the same share is supposedly valued at $10. This year the stock paid 1.42 in its annual dividends to shareholders. By this amount, if you had purchased the stock at $10, you would have a 14.2% dividend yield. What I am baffled about is that the company does not know how to value its own stock and often tells its shareholders that the book value of the share is about $28 (2019 financials). People still buy and sell the stock somewhere from 10 - 15$ each. I quickly saw the opportunity and amassed quite an amount of stock from people who had shares and could not value them properly other than from the price they paid (which was at $10 each).

My question is how would you value the stock given the stock performance over the years? Below are some metrics I compiled. Please note that I am not a finance person so I did some calculations pulled from the bank financials since 2009.

Tickers: VOO, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, ARKW, ARKG, T, KO  (These are my current holdings in my Roth and I firmly believe in all of them for the long run. Tech is everywhere and not going anywhere anytime soon imo).

If I set all my position to a **min. of 5% each, after around 6 years, I get around $40,000** after an initial investment of $10,000. If I set a **minimum % of 0.01 for each of my positions, so that each position would show up, after around 6 years, I get around $51,000** after an initial investment of $10,000.

When looking at the allocation % for each position for the ""No minimum % weight"", I can see that QQQ and VOO have less than 0.05%. **The highest weight was in MSFT at 43% while ARKW is 2nd at 38%**, then AAPL at 14%. I found this odd since I believed that investing more towards index funds, or ETFs that track NASDAQ or the S&amp;P500, would've been better in the long run.

So, I removed ARKW and ARKG due to their recent inception year of 2014. Then, **I swapped VOO with SPY** since VOO had an inception year of 2010 and they both track the same thing. Now, **I have a 21 year period I can look at**, since QQQ's inception year was 1999.

Trying both methods again, 5% min. weight and 0.01% min. weight, I got around $640,000 and $1,200,000 respectively. **Both are very heavily weighted towards AAPL**, which makes sense since if I bought AAPL shares in 1999, each share would've costed around $1.30 and would've grown to over $15,000 each if AAPL never had stock splits.

But again, if I look at the other position weight %s, **QQQ and SPY had less than 0.6% combined** (and in the 5% portfolio, both are at the minimum of 5%).

**SO, is it wrong for me to think that I should NOT invest more in VOO and QQQ (or similar positions), like I am now and instead, more towards solid companies or ETF's (like ARKW) with a long horizon like Apple and Microsoft or other solid companies after I do my DD on each of them?**

,investing,"Economies of scale is the single most important competitive advantage that a company can possess in its market. Economies of scale is achieved when a company can progressively lower its costs as more and more products are produced. Said another way, the more customers you have for a product or service, the more you can spread fixed costs to each customer which lowers the total cost of each product. It follows then that the types of business that most benefit from economies of scale are those that have very high fixed costs as opposed to high variable costs.

So why are economies of scale the most durable competitive advantage available? Imagine you own the only grocery store in town, for years it is profitable, and everyone seems to enjoy going to it. One day a new grocery store opens across the street and begins taking market share. Should you, the owner, panic and sell the store immediately? No of course not. Assuming the new grocery store is not much more efficient and does not have much better selection or technology, your store will always win because you can spread your fixed costs across your large customer base while your competitor cannot. So, if there is a price war you will always win and even before that you will always have lower prices than your competitor.

Ok, what does this have to do with Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway? Amazon’s entire business has been and always will be about scale. I present to you the world’s most famous napkin:

&amp;#x200B;

This is Amazon’s business model in nutshell, drawn in the late 90s by Bezos himself. Note that the inside of this reinforcing loop can be applied to almost any retailer that has ever existed. Amazon’s real special sauce though, is the way that it lowers cost structure by investing in scale and then uses that scale to lower its prices.  Investing in scale means building fulfillment centers, hiring software engineers and doing whatever it takes to own the entire value chain. Crucially, this investment in scale means that it is harder for competitors to replicate Amazon’s value proposition because, as we’ve seen before, investing in high fixed costs businesses mean that you must have enough customers to be able to spread those costs until it reaches a reasonable per unit level. Since Amazon’s second main organization focus is customer service, they are hoping it would be very hard for competitors to get enough eCommerce customers to get those fixed costs down to a competitive level. So, this is the principle behind everything that Amazon does. AWS? Scale. Prime Video? Scale. And so on. You might be wondering, if Amazon keeps entering these extremely high fixed cost businesses, how do they get enough customers to make it work? The answer is Amazon Prime. Amazon is the new grocery store that also gives you everything else in the town for free. So now if you are the owner of the old grocery store in town, you're not just competing with the new store, you're competing with everything else the town has to offer bundled into one. That's how they get around the scale problem and that's how they can keep on entering tough, scale intensive, industries and succeed.",t2_7whqrqof,False,,0,False,Amazon and the Supremacy of Scale,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ij3lia,False,dark,0.63,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,1598748245.0,,[],{},,True,,1598776647.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economies of scale is the single most important competitive advantage that a company can possess in its market.

,investing,"I’ve always heard that when holding onto long term stocks, you shouldn’t panic sell. Ride it out, and keep doing your monthly contributions. Things will be alright and will get back up.

What I don’t understand is, why? Is it all to avoid the capital gains tax?

Say I already have 10K profit after holding for 2 years, then a bearish market appears. The 10K becomes 9, and you can see the 8 and 7 coming.

Why not just sell, wait for it to get down, and just re-buy down there? If it comes back up faster than you expected, just re-buy at where you left off (9K) and there’s no fuss.

I also hear “keep some cash handy so you can buy once it does go down”. Why isn’t that cash just the outcome of selling some of your current positions?

If it is to avoid capital gains tax, what’s the advise if you end-up living in a tax-free country?

Could this person disregard the “ride the wave” advise, and in reality for this scenario it would be wiser to: sell high buy low as you please?

,investing,"For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&amp;P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&amp;P 500 stocks as counterweight.

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

&gt; OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

&gt;Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&amp;P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.

First of all im bored since a few months so i startet my intrest in the stock and cryptocurrency market.

Btw im not a native english speaker nor a writer so excuse me if i did some mistakes in my text, i still hope u can read it and get what im tryna tell you 😉

So as some of you may have heard of XRP (Ripple) for the ones who havent, XRP is a low priced cryptocurrency that offers financial institutions the fastest, most reliable option for
sourcing liquidity on demand.
XRP sells at the moment of typing at around 0.27$ per XRP Coin.

For the past few months i recognized something around the price: the price starts mostly round 0.24/0.25$ sometimes even lower and goes up to its limit (wich lays round 0.29-0.30$) at round 15.- 22. of the month and then drops pretty quick and takes another month till its up again.
in my financial situation atm i cant go all in but now i know +/- when it goes up and when its good to buy  so i always wait a month and get paid out (at my investment as i said i usually buy myself round 100XRP and sell them when the price gets up like 4-5cents which means i make a total profit of round 4-5 bucks) as i mentioned before if u have alot of money this is definitely worth it as it repeats itself nearly every month at literally the same time spawn and its good extra money haha

to say it like if i explain it to my lil siter if u invest round 240$ in XRP it gets you at some point if the price is low enough round 1000XRP that means if the Price of the XRP goes up by only 1 cent you make 10$! if you buy urself 10000XRP u get arround 100$ per cent it goes up!

,investing,"**Intro**

When it comes to building a portfolio of SWAN (sleep well at night) stocks for the long term, HSY is a layup. In the world of stock investing, HSY is an ideal stock for beginners and seasoned investors alike because of its relatively simple business model and its ability to generate consistent returns. The business itself is very straightforward. HSY owns some very recognizable brands such as Reese's and KitKat (HSY owns the rights to KitKat in the US). On average they manage to sell more candy than the year before and with it also raise prices at a rate higher than inflation. As the bulk of their profits are earned in the US, their income statements (reported in USD) are an accurate reflection of what they actually earned. Compare that to other excellent companies like CL, KO etc which are a little harder to evaluate as they earn most of their profits overseas and you have to factor in currency fluctuations to get the real picture (their annual reports usually do a good job of it though).  As Peter Lynch said, ""Invest in what you know"" and it's safe to say most Americans have consumed a Hershey's product at some point in their lives. Heck, you can even use the excuse of ""market research""  to buy some Reese's peanut butter cups the next time you go to the store.

It's very useful to anyone looking to research individual stocks. While paying for a subscription yourself can cost several hundreds of dollars annually, most public libraries in the US give you access to one or both of those services for free. I'll try to sum up the key metrics shared in the link above (anyone can view that page even without a subscription)

Over the last 10 years

Net sales growth of \~4% (What's even more impressive is that most of it was achieved with volume increases and pricing power alone. Acquisitions had little to do with it)

EPS growth 8-10%

Div yield 2-3% (The payout ratio stays around 50% which means you also see dividend growth that's 8-10%)

They buy back roughly 1% of outstanding shares each year.

Just like that you get 11-13% CAGR (excluding PE compression/expansion). ROIC consistently in the high teens to 20+ (consumer staples usually average in the mid teens)

Operating margin has increased from 17.4% to 21% (PEP for example was around 15% last year)

To check the quality of the balance sheet, we look at the interest coverage ratio and Net Debt w.r.t Operating Profits. With capital light businesses like HSY, their ability to grow profits/free cash flow is a better indicator of financial strength than shareholder equity.

Interest coverage ratio (Interest expense/EBIT) \~ 10 (A double digit value for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

Net Debt/EBIT \~ 2.5 (Anything less than 3 for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

&amp;#x200B;

**Stock Performance**

HSY has historically fluctuated between a PE of 30 (overpriced) to a PE of 20 (a bargain). Every once in a blue moon the PE dips below 20 and the div yield approaches 3% at which point it becomes a screaming bargain. Barring a total economic collapse or horrendous mismanagement, it's very unlikely you'll see HSY trading at a PE of 15. I would say a PE of 23-25 is a fair price for a wonderful company.

As with any investment, the price you pay affects future returns. To get the real picture of returns generated by HSY, one needs to look at a full business cycle as consumer staples generally tend to outperform during a recession.

[The absolute worst time to buy HSY in the last 15 years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2005&amp;firstMonth=4&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=HSY&amp;allocation1_1=100) would have been in early 2005 when the PE was over 30 and the dividend yield was below 1.5%. A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in April 2005 would result in a present value of $34,863 with a CAGR of 8.49% (underperformed the SPY which returned $37,404 at 8.98%).

[Buying it at its lows](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2008&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=HSY&amp;allocation1_1=100) in early 2008 when the PE was under 20 and the dividend yield was over 3%, A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in January 2008 would result in a present value of $50,619 with a CAGR of 13.76% (outperformed the SPY which returned $28,659 at 8.73%).

Realistically speaking, for an investor who DCAs into this stock, their returns would've been somewhere between 8.5% - 13.8%. HSY is not a stock that you can expect 20%+ CAGR from, but with some luck compounding at 11-12% can build significant wealth (and potentially even outperform SPY).

**Risks**

As far as stocks go, HSY has to be one of the safest investments out there. The company is very conservatively run as the Hershey Trust owns roughly 40% of the company (but over 80% voting rights) and uses the dividends to fund a school for underprivileged children. The dividend is sacrosanct and HSY management is less likely to jeopardize the dividend in search of growth. Consumer staples as a business also face less disruption than other industries. Profits are consistent and the business requires fairly little reinvestment. Candy, alcohol and tobacco are centuries old and consumer tastes change fairly slowly which gives companies plenty of time to adapt. MSFT would go out of business if they were still selling the same OS they made in the 90s. HSY on the other hand is more or less still selling the same candy it was 30-40 years ago. That being said, past performance is no guarantee of future results. So let's address some realistic risks

\- Ruining the quality of the product due to cost cuts in search of short term profits. [Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez did this to the Cadbury Creme Egg](https://theconservativeincomeinvestor.com/why-mondelez-stock-hasnt-gone-up/), which didn't bode well for the stock. A big part of the reason why I'm willing to pay a premium for a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (over some generic brand candy) is because of the taste.  HSY would lose their hard earned market share and goodwill in search of short term gains.

\- Compromising the balance sheet for a bad acquisition. KHC is a good example of this. The 3G method involves slashing costs and levering up the balance sheet to acquire more businesses. Of course, if the acquisition doesn't pan out the stock gets punished accordingly. HSY has tried to build their international presence through acquisitions and it hasn't panned out well so far. Lately they've started diversifying into savory snacks. However, these tend to be pretty small in nature.

\- A sugar tax to combat obesity. I don't think it'll hurt the underlying business too much, but HSY might start trading at a lower earnings multiple.

\- E-commerce might affect HSY a bit. Outside of a few holidays the bulk of candy sales come from impulse purchases a consumer makes at the checkout counter at the store. It usually isn't something a person puts on their shopping list. I think with some proactive management, HSY can get around that by working with vendors to advertise their products while checking out online (much like how pizza joints upsell soda/breadsticks etc at checkout time).

**Conclusion**

If you've made it this far, I thank you for reading this post. I mostly wrote this for people who might be looking into buying individual stocks. I think HSY is an excellent stock for those looking for an above average dividend yield and dividend growth. Buffet often speaks fondly of his See's Candies investment. Much like his own investment, with some luck HSY's dividends alone can pay you back your initial investment and then some over an investing lifetime. As always, sticking with a low cost index fund is a sound strategy. Even a stock like HSY requires a few hours of work each year.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;amp;timePeriod=2&amp;amp;startYear=2005&amp;amp;firstMonth=4&amp;amp;endYear=2020&amp;amp;lastMonth=12&amp;amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;amp;includeYTD=false&amp;amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;amp;annualOperation=0&amp;amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;amp;frequency=4&amp;amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;amp;showYield=false&amp;amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;amp;symbol1=HSY&amp;amp;allocation1_1=100""&gt;The absolute worst time to buy HSY in the last 15 years&lt;/a&gt; would have been in early 2005 when the PE was over 30 and the dividend yield was below 1.5%. A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in April 2005 would result in a present value of $34,863 with a CAGR of 8.49% (underperformed the SPY which returned $37,404 at 8.98%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;amp;timePeriod=2&amp;amp;startYear=2008&amp;amp;firstMonth=1&amp;amp;endYear=2020&amp;amp;lastMonth=12&amp;amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;amp;includeYTD=false&amp;amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;amp;annualOperation=0&amp;amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;amp;frequency=4&amp;amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;amp;showYield=false&amp;amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;amp;symbol1=HSY&amp;amp;allocation1_1=100""&gt;Buying it at its lows&lt;/a&gt; in early 2008 when the PE was under 20 and the dividend yield was over 3%, A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in January 2008 would result in a present value of $50,619 with a CAGR of 13.76% (outperformed the SPY which returned $28,659 at 8.73%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically speaking, for an investor who DCAs into this stock, their returns would&amp;#39;ve been somewhere between 8.5% - 13.8%. HSY is not a stock that you can expect 20%+ CAGR from, but with some luck compounding at 11-12% can build significant wealth (and potentially even outperform SPY).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as stocks go, HSY has to be one of the safest investments out there. The company is very conservatively run as the Hershey Trust owns roughly 40% of the company (but over 80% voting rights) and uses the dividends to fund a school for underprivileged children. The dividend is sacrosanct and HSY management is less likely to jeopardize the dividend in search of growth. Consumer staples as a business also face less disruption than other industries. Profits are consistent and the business requires fairly little reinvestment. Candy, alcohol and tobacco are centuries old and consumer tastes change fairly slowly which gives companies plenty of time to adapt. MSFT would go out of business if they were still selling the same OS they made in the 90s. HSY on the other hand is more or less still selling the same candy it was 30-40 years ago. That being said, past performance is no guarantee of future results. So let&amp;#39;s address some realistic risks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Ruining the quality of the product due to cost cuts in search of short term profits. &lt;a href=""https://theconservativeincomeinvestor.com/why-mondelez-stock-hasnt-gone-up/""&gt;Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez did this to the Cadbury Creme Egg&lt;/a&gt;, which didn&amp;#39;t bode well for the stock. A big part of the reason why I&amp;#39;m willing to pay a premium for a Reese&amp;#39;s Peanut Butter Cup (over some generic brand candy) is because of the taste.  HSY would lose their hard earned market share and goodwill in search of short term gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Compromising the balance sheet for a bad acquisition. KHC is a good example of this. The 3G method involves slashing costs and levering up the balance sheet to acquire more businesses. Of course, if the acquisition doesn&amp;#39;t pan out the stock gets punished accordingly. HSY has tried to build their international presence through acquisitions and it hasn&amp;#39;t panned out well so far. Lately they&amp;#39;ve started diversifying into savory snacks. However, these tend to be pretty small in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- A sugar tax to combat obesity. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll hurt the underlying business too much, but HSY might start trading at a lower earnings multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- E-commerce might affect HSY a bit. Outside of a few holidays the bulk of candy sales come from impulse purchases a consumer makes at the checkout counter at the store. It usually isn&amp;#39;t something a person puts on their shopping list. I think with some proactive management, HSY can get around that by working with vendors to advertise their products while checking out online (much like how pizza joints upsell soda/breadsticks etc at checkout time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far, I thank you for reading this post. I mostly wrote this for people who might be looking into buying individual stocks. I think HSY is an excellent stock for those looking for an above average dividend yield and dividend growth. Buffet often speaks fondly of his See&amp;#39;s Candies investment. Much like his own investment, with some luck HSY&amp;#39;s dividends alone can pay you back your initial investment and then some over an investing lifetime. As always, sticking with a low cost index fund is a sound strategy. Even a stock like HSY requires a few hours of work each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; HSY good. VTSAX good.&lt;/p&gt;

While the margin loan only accept 2x leverage at most, investors are usually forced to sell even if they actually don't mind to keep hold or you can only leverage like 1.2\~1.5x.

,investing,"Let's get this straight: the price of a stock is not random\*. The price is (theoretically) all future earnings of a company discounted at some rate (depending on the risk of the stock) to the present day. What this means is that in order for you to rationally price a stock, you first want to see what money it will deliver to you in the future, and how likely it is to deliver that money. The more earnings and/or the more likely it is to achieve those earnings, the higher the price. So, to price a stock, you form your expectations about all future earnings and discount them depending on the risk of the stock to today's money, and now you can rationally decide if a stock is a buy or sell or even short. This whole thing is called the Discounted Cash Flow Model.

Now, this is the essence of this post: a change in expectations about future earnings, or a change in the discount rate are the only things that change investor sentiment about a stock. It is not how it has historically performed nor about its current situation. It is always how do investors feel about the future of the company.

A lot of people on this sub like that point out the history of a stock to jusifity going long, or the fact that the company is projected to make a lot of money or that it currently does. The reality is that all of that is reflected in the price of the stock. You can use historical earnings to project future earnings, but that is all, and those future earnings are already reflected in the stock's price. Only a change in expectations or the risk of a company meeting expectations influence the price of the stock. This ultimately means only future events can change the price of the stock, and unless you can predict the future, for all intents and purposes, the price of a stock today is right.

Here's a consequence of this line of thinking:

You want to know why Apple is $2.1T in market cap? It is a mix of high earnings in the future and a very low risk of missing.

Have low risk necessarily means having lower future returns. Almost all (&gt;97%) returns are explained by taking on more risk (using the Fama-French 5 factor model). This is the fundamental idea behind investing, and is basically a law at this point. High risk = high reward.

Apple being priced high means that it's expectations are high (meaning for anyone who invests in Apple right now, they are expecting Apple to earn lots of money) and those expectations are not terribly risky. This ultimately means that for Apple investors to make returns at or above the market, Apple has to consistently beat expectations and become even a safer investment in order for current investors to make returns.

What this ultimately means is that in the long-term, large cap growth stocks are not the best investments you should have. Companies like Apple are basically guaranteeing you low returns in the long run. If you have a long time horizon, you should be investing in systematically risky assets because in the long run, you make more returns. Things like value, and small cap stocks are higher risk and higher reward.

,investing,"Hi all,

I'm interested in BRK.B as a long-term hold. I know some here are worried about BRK after Warren and Charlie but personally I think it will drop then recover in relatively short order.

,investing,"Hey people, I see a lot of talk on investment websites about buying  stocks, bonds, gold, crypto, foreign currency, art, collectables, real  estate... etc

This is all fine, but this type of investment has some downsides, at least for me personally:

\-  it's pretty much passive... you just buy stocks, or whatever and wait,  you do nothing with it, you just expect passive income from it

\-  you have no control over what you bought (with the exception of real-estate perhaps), even if you own a few stocks of, say, Coca-Cola  you have no say regarding its management etc... even if you own gold  bars... you can do nothing with them except sell them at appropriate  time

\- I am not really sure if these are even real investments at all, as they hardly create new value, at least  not directly... when you buy stock it just changes owner, nothing  physical happens in the world as a result of your investment (I know it might indirectly benefit the company whose stocks you buy, but it's  still not that you're directly creating any value)

\-  The return is quite predictable-  the higher the  risk, the higher potential return, but there are very few possibilities  to earn a lot, with low risk. Return of investment is generally low, unless there's a lot of risk involved.

**So  there's another type of investment that fascinates me much more, but I  see very little talk about it on the Internet: investing in machinery,  means of production, capital goods, etc...**

I am wondering  why it is so rarely mentioned on websites about investment. What branch  of economics deal with these types of investments? Where to study it?

I think this type of investment is much more interesting for the following reasons:

\-  when you buy a machine or build a factory and put it to use, you're  directly contributing to the economic growth, you're directly creating  new value

\- there is **way more potential**  to profit because **the value of factories, capital goods, etc... is not  the same for everyone and it's not necessarily related to their price**.  Whoever buys a stock can expect exactly the same return from that stock.  But if a doctor who is the owner of a private clinic buys a gastroscope  and knows how to perform gastroscopy or has employees who know,  he can expect huge return of the  investment from such a purchase while that same piece of equipment would  be pretty much worthless to me, as I am not a doctor and I don't own a clinic.

Or another example: for a  multinational brewing company, the value of a regional brewery is much  higher than for some other random company or individual, because that  company has its brand name, know how, developed marketing network, and  upon acquiring a regional brewery it can make much higher profit from  it, than some other company without the experience in brewing  business would ever be able to make.

\- with these  investments you have much more control over what you bought and the  return of investment does not depend only on the value of the equipment  bought, but also on your skill to put it to use...

I am wondering why these types of investments are neglected? If investment was all about buying stocks and other financial assets, the economy would collapse... all the companies would be like Berkshire Hathaway...

,investing,"This Post intends to give an overview over the ticker RLFTF, it is divided in different sections to give a holistic overview over RLFTF. RLFTF is a Drug Development Company registered at the Swiss Stock Exchange RLF.SW and US OTC Ticker RLFTF.

RLFTF's patented drug RLF-100^(TM)(Aviptadil/VIP) has a FDA Fast Track designation and is in two Clinical Trials and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program. Preliminary data show a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most critical COVID-19 ICU Patients.^(3)

**Clinical Data and Mechanism of Action - why this is the best COVID-19 drug.**

RLF-100(Aviptadil/VIP) has a 30 year research history and is already Approved by some Countries for other Indications (UK Approved for Errectile Dysfunction and EU Orphan drug status for Sarcoidosis treatment \*EU designation (EU/3/07/473)), it is already known to be a safe drug with minimal side-effects. ^(5,6)

*Mechanism Of Action*

1. RLF-100 inhibits the SARS-COV-2(COVID19) Virus from replicating itself by blocking the      respective receptors. **It is the only known Drug** so far that **prevents      the Virus from replicating**(spreading), it act's preventive and not just symptomatic. ^(1)
2. RLF-100 prevents and/or stops the Cytokine Storm, is highly anti-inflamantory and acts on RANTES (CCL5) - in almost the same way that e.g. CYDY's LL drug does.^(2)
3. RLF-100 is a natural peptide produced and used by the body to protect &amp; heal the lung and to      improve blood oxygenation. Severe CASES of COVID-19 have shown low levels of exactly this Peptide.^(3)

*Clinical Data*

Currently there are 2 Clinical Trials underway and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program.

1. Phase 2/3 Trial, IV RLF-100 for Critical COVID-19 Patients, Estimated completion in September 2020 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697)
2. FDA granted IND for Clinical Trial of RLF-100 in inhaled version with the goal to provide a **preventive treatment at home** to prevent a moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.^(4) Estimated      completion in November [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096)
3. FDA Intermediate Population Expanded Access of RLF-100, Expanded Access Program for cases too critical to be part of the above studies. In this EAP aims to treat the most critical COVID-19 Patient. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839)

All currently available Clinical Data regarding COVID-19 is from the Expanded Access. The first 21 Patients showed a Rapid recovery and a mortality reduction of over 90%. This patients consist out of the worst case COVID-19 cases like patients with combined double lung transplant rejection and severe COVID-19 infections. ^(3)

*Summary:*

RLF-100 blocks the COVID-19 Virus, prevents a cytokine storm, heals the lungs and improves blood oxygenation with a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most severe cases.

*Further possible indications*

Possible further indications for RLF-100 are almost all lung affecting diseases, as RLF-100 protects and heals the lungs.

Further RLF-100 acts on RANTES(CCL5) and could be indicated for treatment of HIV, Cancer and other RANTES specific diseases after further studies.

**Current Demand / Demand for Expanded Access**

\- On behalf of Relief Therapeutics, NeuroRX is currently fielding multiple requests from representatives of health ministries, who would like to access RLF-100 for their countries. ^(7)

\- There is currently a high volume of requests for Expanded Access from US licensed physicians ^(8)

**FDA Fast Track &amp; NeuroRX Partnership**

RLFTF has a FDA Fast Track designation for the RLF-100 Drug^(1) all clinical trials and studies are conducted by Relief Therapeutics partner NeuroRX, a privately held US Company. Relief Therapeutics own all rights on RLF-100 and pays NeuroRX to conduct the trials. ^(6)

**Share Price Target**

While it is difficult to determine a Share Price for a Stock which this Potential, my personal calculations put the potential between 5-20$. Analysis see the intermediate Share Price target at 18$ which would be a 3600% increase of the current Price.^(9)

**Catalysts in the near Future**

In the Upcoming Days we expect an announcement of a Partnership with a large drug distribution and logistics Company. ^(10)

1. A Board member of RLFTF saidduring an interview that by October they will be ready to deliver      treatment to 100'000 patients. ^(10)
2. Study Results of the Phase 2/3 Study are due in September. Judged by the Expanded Access data, which treats more severe Cases than in the Study, the results are expected to be very good. ^(10)
3. It is expected that the Data      Monitoring Committee might Stop the study and recommend an approval to the FDA, so that Patients from the Placebo control group can be treated as well.^(10)

**Stock Exchange, Markets and Regulatory Specifics**

RLFTF is registered as RLF.SW at the Swiss Stock Exchange and is subject to swiss exchange law's and regulations. All Management Transactions and Transactions of Significant Shareholders have to be Published according to the Swiss Exchange Regulations.

Publishing of (Corporate) News is only allowed off Market (at least 90 minutes prior to Market opening) if News is published during the Market hours, trading will be suspended for some time. There is little chance with this stock for a late ""jump-on"" once a big catalyst is released, as it will be off-market.

In the US RLFTF is a OTC Traded Stock. RLFTF just filed a OTCQB Application and will therefor also be regulated by the SEC in the future, though i feel the Swiss Regulation is stricter anyway.

**Information about Market Cap, Outstanding Shares and Expected Earnings.**

There was a very comprehensive interview by a Swiss Investment Newspaper covering the Above topics, please check out [https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478](https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478) , it contains almost everything we want to know at this Point.

**Disclaimer**

I follow the clinical development of RLF-100 since the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 and i'm invested since early spring, i see myself as a long term investor. My primary investment motivation is that, after extensive reasearch over months, i believe in the potential of this drug. Please do your own due diligence prior to investment and let me know if you would like to have more information included in this Post, i'll try to update it accordingly.

,investing,"Goldman hosted a virtual NDR with Michael Spencer, General Manager - Investor Relations at $MSFT\* yesterday. Goldman has a Buy rating and $235 price target. Here are their takeaways:

1. Azure: Recall, in 4Q20, Azure growth decelerated to 47% yoy (50% cc) compared to 59% growth in 3Q20 (61% cc). Investors continue to focus on the pace of deceleration within Azure, the impact of COVID-19 on cloud migrations and consumption, and changes in the revenue mix between consumption (IaaS and PaaS) and the per user SaaS revenue (EMS). Management noted several puts and takes to the impact of COVID-19 on Azure growth, noting some impact in consumption in heavily impacted industries and a focus on optimization, noting however that the overall trend has been customers redoubling their commitment to migrating to the public cloud. Management added, that as the pace of growth in EMS moderates, with enterprise mobility seats growing 26% yoy in 4Q20 versus 34% in F3Q20, there will be a corresponding impact to overall Azure growth as the revenue mix continues to shift more towards IaaS and PaaS.
2. Commercial Cloud Gross Margins: Management noted continuous improvement in IaaS and PaaS gross margins, as the company continues to expand capacity within its existing datacenter footprint, increase power efficiency, and optimize the company’s existing software stack to run more efficiently. However, management noted the pace of margin expansion within Azure will be partially offset as revenue mixes more towards lower gross margin consumption revenue (and away from SaaS). Recall, in 4Q20 Commercial Cloud gross margins reached 66% (+1pt yoy) compared to 67% in F3Q20 (+4pts yoy), highlighting the impact from moderating revenue growth in the Azure per user business.
3. Office 365: Recall in 4Q20 Office 365 commercial seat growth moderated to 15% yoy, compared to 20% in F3Q20. Management attributed some of the slowdown to better than expected adoption of a 6 month E1 free trial the company introduced following COVID19 (which ended in June) along with some weakness within SMB. Management also noted strength in the pipeline with the opportunity to convert free trial customers to paid users as the trials expire. Management noted continued room for APRU growth driven by SKU migration with a large E1 installed base noting traction in E3 and E5 SKUs; strength in E5 has been driven in part by advanced security and compliance offerings. With respect to Teams, management noted a number of enhancements in recent months as the company continues to close the feature functionality gap relative to competitive offerings in both collaboration and videoconferencing software.
4. Windows: Management highlighted that Windows Commercial continues to grow as a percentage of overall Windows revenue (\~30% as of 2Q20) driving the mix of recurring revenue higher within the segment. Windows Pro, Windows Non-Pro, and Other comprise the remaining \~40%, \~20% and 10% respectively. Management noted commercial PC strength following mid-March shelter in place orders began to fade in 4Q; however, this was offset by strength in the consumer market. Going forward, management pointed to expectations for a low-teens decline in the Windows OEM business driven by continued weakness in SMB and a tough compare.
5. Gaming: With more people working from home, gaming continues to show strength, with gaming revenue growing 64% yoy in F4Q20. Heading into an upcoming console cycle management noted that increased demand associated with WFH should result in lower inventory levels relative to prior console cycles. Management also noted balanced strength throughout the company’s gaming portfolio in 4Q20, with strength in first party titles and the company’s subscription business which surpassed 10mn subscribers in April.",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$MSFT - takeaways from virtual investor meeting at Goldman yesterday,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihlq10,False,dark,0.9,,public,57,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,57,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598566305.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman hosted a virtual NDR with Michael Spencer, General Manager - Investor Relations at $MSFT* yesterday.

,investing," What are your thoughts on these 3 stocks? I still think they are 3 great dividend stocks and dividend stocks to buy?

I feel pretty confident in Pfizer, Ratheon, and Exxon as stocks. They distribute great dividends, have a strong and rich history, and aren't going anywhere. Pfizer is in the vaccine race and could be accepted as a vaccine with Operation Warp Speed. Ratheon is a military stock and has some great techology, which will improve over time. 

As a dividend investor, I think that these stocks will be strong over time and continue to be popular stocks amongst the dividend investor community. I'm not a finacial advisor, but I love these 3 stocks and will probably buy Ratheon in the future. I own Pfizer and Exxon at the moment. I believe Exxon will adapt as a company and suck up more energy companies as they go green.

Feel free to skip over this post and leave the obligatory ""stop pumping uranium"" or ""nuclear power is terrible"" comment at the door. For those that aren't, here is another update on my series of posts about the uranium sector, a sector with the most asymmetrical risk/reward opportunity in the current market.

So, why am I brining you yet another update? Partially to present to you a link that will direct you to a whole library of different analysis reports on the uranium industry as a whole and about specific companies in the sector. There are 105 different reports just for 2020 and more for the previous years. Just search for whatever specific thing you are looking for and read away. Here is the link:
https://uraniumequities.com/research-reports/

However, that is definitely not the only reason I am writing you all another update. In the past few years, a lot of analysts in the uranium sector (best example is Rick Rule) have been saying that a restart of Japanese nuclear power plants would signal the start of a new bull market in the sector. As years passed, the uranium bull case has had plenty of other catalysts to get it going (Kazatomprom and Cameco mine closures and further [supply cuts for the coming 2 years](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2) on Kazatomprom's part, increased number of new power plants constructed and planned in Asia, no significant new mines coming online, more support for nuclear energy in the US and several more that add up to the bull case I have been describing in my previous posts).

Now, the restart of several Japanese nuclear reactors has joined the growing list of catalysts as reported [here:](https://mobile.twitter.com/SStapczynski/status/1296705957020332034)
 
Although it doesn't seem like much of a change in the grand scheme of things, one has to remember Japan still has significant uranium fuel reserves that will now be used to fuel their nuclear reactors, further decreasing the global uranium supply and bringing new demand back online. Since restarts of power plants typically require a significant amount of 'new fuel' to start their power production with the building of a new core, these restarts will only add to the increasing supply deficit as portrayed [here](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/supply-demand) by Cameco 

So why is this time different? Why is it that people have been predicting this thing to happen for years and it hasn't changed? I get exactly why the people that ask this are skeptical and rightly so that they are, because people have been saying it since 2016. What is different now however, is the above mentioned report that Japan is restarting faster than anticipated. Which, as mentioned above, was widely seen as the thing that will light a fire under the sector once more

Now, what does this change about a bull case that was already convincing enough as it is in my opinion? It adds yet another catalyst to the list and further charges up the bull case. Many expected Japan to take several more years to start bringing back their nuclear power plants, so this is a very nice boost for the sector and one many analysts did not take into direct account when calculating the ever increasing supply deficit. But even with most reactors still offline in Japan, the amount of electricity generated by nuclear power plants around the world is now [ back to levels not seens since 2006](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Nuclear-generation-in-2019-close-to-record-high).

TLDR:
The restart of Japanese nuclear power plants is a big positive for the uranium sector, just around a time when there were already several catalysts present for an extremely compelling bull case. Demand is only increasing while supply is being cut by the world's biggest producer Kazatomprom. The deficit is growing and the spot price for uranium will soon increase to incentivize new production.

&gt;Disclosures filed this week

They disclosed that they bought APPLE, GOLDMAN SACHS, Home Depot

&gt;The Fed holds an expansive list of other companies indirectly, including names like [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL) and [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GS), through exchange-traded funds it has purchased.

Prices before were: 200-250, 135-142, 140-170

Now: 500, 210, 288

The fed's have ***doubled*** their money in these ETF's at least.

&gt;In addition, it has purchased bonds in speculative-grade companies as well as ETFs, including the [SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=JNK), a fund in which the Fed holds a $412 billion position.

That could be monitored by looking at SPY.

Now we know that the feds printed 4 trillion dollars, lets say they invested 1 trillion with some leverage.

Are they super rich right now?

,investing,"Nothing huge here, but I just wanted to share a thought that the recent market behavior feels eerily reminiscent of the recent market in January 2018, with the exception that we are not coming out of a low volatility environment like we were back then.  We get a lot of discussion of comparisons to 2000, but I wanted to bring up a more recent time that feels quite similar.

**Just Some Anecdotes &amp; Similarities**

* We are seeing some very notable divergences in the market, where the leaders are making up all the attribution of gains, and the laggards are falling further and further behind. This frequently precedes significant drawdowns.
* We are coming off a period where the dollar going into a notable downtrend in relatively quick fashion, and then started to either form a bottom or consolidation. This too happened in 2018 - dollar strength tends to be risk off, and dollar weakness tends to be great for risk assets.
* Treasury bonds and other bonds starting to under-perform significantly after a strong upward run where they were previously strongly correlated with risk assets.
* Volatility starting to grind higher ***despite*** the fact that markets are similarly moving higher.
* Put to call ratio hitting extremely low levels at a time when stocks are strongly overbought.
* Record lows in short interest in major market indexes

Thing is, just like 2018, I can easily see markets continuing to grind higher for at least a little while, and we're clearly not going to see a blowout in a VIX ETN like we did back then. But to say that things feel really stretched right now is a massive understatement.

&lt;li&gt;We are coming off a period where the dollar going into a notable downtrend in relatively quick fashion, and then started to either form a bottom or consolidation. This too happened in 2018 - dollar strength tends to be risk off, and dollar weakness tends to be great for risk assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasury bonds and other bonds starting to under-perform significantly after a strong upward run where they were previously strongly correlated with risk assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volatility starting to grind higher &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the fact that markets are similarly moving higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put to call ratio hitting extremely low levels at a time when stocks are strongly overbought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record lows in short interest in major market indexes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, just like 2018, I can easily see markets continuing to grind higher for at least a little while, and we&amp;#39;re clearly not going to see a blowout in a VIX ETN like we did back then. But to say that things feel really stretched right now is a massive understatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few other items I&amp;#39;ve been picking up on, but they probably aren&amp;#39;t really worth discussing here.&lt;/p&gt;

UTZ/CCH MERGER

Listen up smooth brains, I know youre sick of these crazy premiums, and are looking for the next sleeper pick to jump in on, so here it is.

Tomorrow (8/27/20) at 9am a $CCH shareholder vote will be held to merge blank check/spac company Collier Creek Holdings, with Utz Quality Foods snack giant. And im about to tell you why you should put your chips in (no pun intended).  If the vote goes through, the ticker will change to $UTZ. This is the same SPAC merger structure that Draftkings (DKNG) and Nikola Motors (NKLA) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE)

“Why would I bet on a snack company IPO paulbo? That’s not EVs, gambling, or space travel”

**Well, my friend, semiconductor chips aren’t the only kind of chips you can make money on in the stock market, and ill tell you why.** But first, for those who aren’t aware of UTZ, ill give you a little introduction.

Here is the investor Presentation from august 11th for starters: [http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;iid=11139662](http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;iid=11139662)

**What is UTZ Quality Foods?**

Utz Quality Foods, Inc., more commonly known as Utz, is the largest independent, privately held snack food brand in the United States. Based in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the company produces a wide variety of potato chips, pretzels, and other snacks, with most distribution being limited to the eastern United States.

They are a Manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of branded snacks in the U.S., including potato chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, pork skins, pub/party mixes, and veggie snacks  Strong portfolio of national and regional brands, including Utz, Good Health, Boulder Canyon, Zapp’s, and Golden Flake. If you are familiar with any of these absolutely fire snacks, your probably already buying calls and shares. If not, keep reading.

Utz is 99-year-old family company with over 40 years of consecutive Comparable Sales Growth. It’s the #1 largest privately owned snack company up until now, Its #2 salty snack company in its Core geographies; #4 nationally. 2020E Pro Forma Net Sales of $932 million and Projected Further Adj. EBITDA of $124 million. Yes, almost a billion dollars in sales. This is no start up, this is a blue chip, established company that you have the chance to get in on the ground floor, pre-merger.

**It’s Undervalued**

UTZ is being valued at $1.56 billion. They had a billion in sales. Furthermore, If you happened to catch Jim Cramers bit on it, youll have heard him mention how cheap this valuation is. They came to this valuation at an 11.6x multiple of their EBITDA. Competitors like Pepsico (frito lays) are valued at 14.7x.

As you can see, this valuation is very conservative. Especially when you realize how much growth opportunity UTZ has in comparison to its competitors. It has by far the most growth potential.

As you can see in the investor presentation, the growth in the past 20 years has been flawless. Even in recession, it has grown right on cue. Not only is it a growth stock and undervalued, it is also RECESSION PROOF. And it even has a dividend for those boomers out there. Now you can begin to see why this is such a good play.

**There is tons of room to grow at an exponential rate.**

Utz right now is primarily sold in the north east, but they are going public, so that they can go NATIONAL. Imagine buying a future frito lays when it was worth a couple billion.

“Okay fine Paulbo, it’s a great company, but does it have any real hype driving retail buying?”

Surprisingly it does. This is **Boomer King Jim Cramers** favorite snack company as hes from PA. Hes mentioned this multiple times now on his show. He even had the Executives on in July to talk to him, briefly driving the stock price up to 16$ after hours.

**Warren Buffet** even mentioned that UTZ is his favorite snack company, and thought about buying it back in 2015. [https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/](https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/)  If Berkshire buys into UTZ, this thing is going to the moon.

Don’t underestimate boomer hype. They have the most buying power of all of retail, and going into the uncertainty of the current world situation with the virus and election season they are going to be looking for a solid blue chip dividend play.

**WHALE MONEY IS BUYING THE SPAC ALREADY**

Institutions like Bamco and Goldman Sachs and cch itslef are currently owning 77% of the public float. That is a higher institutional ownership than any spac ive seen so far. They are making big bets on this company, and most big institutions wont even buy spacs until their mergers are complete. The smart money is going to pile on.

On top of all of these great aspects of UTZ, the most important is that their Pretzels are fucking fire. That fact alone makes this play worth it.

**Final valuation and price targets.**

At ticker change, according to the investor presentation, there will be 110 million shares outstanding. Half of them will be owned by the founding family. The other half will be public float. Of that 55 million, 77% will be owned by the current CCH insiders, and the institutions.

Utz is being valued at 1.5 billion. Undervalued af

If Utz is valued at 15x pro forma 2021 Ebitda of 134m, rather than 11.6x, the market cap would be $2 Billion(still even conservative). That would calculate to  $18.12 at ticker change

As I am writing this, the stock is up to $16 dollars, with a few days before ticker change. This is after trading in the 13.50-14.00 range since they announced the merger earlier this summer. The hype is starting to build, but if youre in under $20 YOU ARE STILL VERY EARLY. This will be fairly valued at $20 within a week maybe two, and itll be at $25 eoy.

Positions:

Warrants

Sept and Oct $15, $17.5, $20 calls

Jan $17.5, $20, $25 calls for a longer play.

TL:DR Utz Quality foods snack giant is merging with a spac and is undervalued by like 30-50%. This company is one of the largest and fastest growing snack companys in the country.  The boomers, jim cramer, warren buffet, dividend ETFS and fat people from the north east are going to be loving this stock. Super low risk and a possible high reward with warrants or calls. Premiums are still low on calls, and there is a ton of upside. The company also makes fire pretzels and cheeseballs.",t2_lj8xn,False,,0,False,CCH/UTZ Merger DD UTZ quality foods,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihczb8,False,dark,0.89,,public,34,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,34,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598524801.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was meant for WSB but they dont let you post spacs i guess, so i hope you guys appreciate&lt;/p&gt;

Fidelity, one of the largest mutual fund firms in the U.S., is also leading the Street in bitcoin research and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wise Origin links back to Fidelity Investments via Jubber and Fidelity&amp;#39;s brokerage service and distribution subsidiaries, both of which are set to receive sales compensation from the new fund. It also shares a Boston office building with Fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"We all used to know blackberry as that phone with the cool keyboard and the hip phone. Ever since Android and the iPhone came along, they took over the smartphone market share and blackberry went downhill from there.

Since then and many years of disappointment, Blackberry has been slowly transforming into a leader in the software industry, most notably with their QNX technology.

Last year, they had 150 million cars installed with their technology and as of their last earnings report, they increased this number to 175 million which is a growth of 17%.  This is around 30% of the market share of modern cars and upper management projects they can gain up to 60-70% of the market share in the next years.

The automobile industry is down and this has caused Blackberry to go down a bit. However, Blackberry has recently won bids with Hyundai and Volvo which is something to look forward to. Once the automobile industry goes back up, Blackberry will most likely follow.

There is also the promise of 5G coming out soon. As per Blackberry,  5G will lead to more attacks on ""mobile endpoints"". This is where Blackberry comes in as they also have the ""Spark Suites"" which solves this problem. Although they just came out with this platform, it has been very well perceived by their customers.

lastly, they recently announced that Xpeng P7 will be using the QNX Technology. Xpeng is one of the leading electric vehicles in China.  This is great news (which is why it went up 6.28%) as most of their revenues come from North America and this is a great market to expand to.

There are other products that have been doing good for Blackberry (Athoc), but these are the main reasons I am bullish on this stock.

Currently, Blackberry is not seen as innovative since they have been primarily seen as a phone maker, but now they are well diversified in the software business and have been building their products and focusing a lot on R&amp;D. There is great potential for the coming years for Blackberry. This is not a get rich stock but is a hold for the next upcoming years before we see appreciation.

With the most recent crisis there was an actual rationale as to why growth would outperform; most tech is considered ""growth"" and a lot of tech companies actually did do well with everyone at home. So I went back to the earlier days and looked at the great recession, and it surprised me.

,investing,"I am posting this here instead of the Daily Advice Thread because I believe (hope) it will be relevant to any investor looking into protecting short term gains in this crazy volatile market and am looking to spur a conversation about both tax management strategy and position protection.

I am sitting on a 200% gain from a mid March purchase of a covid high flying tech stock.  If I sell now, I lock in the profit, but the trade will be taxed as a ""short term capital gain (STCG)"".  If I sell for the same price in March 2021 the trade counts as a ""long term capital gain (LTCG)"" and my tax bill is significantly smaller.  However, the earnings report for the stock is a month away, covid news ranges from promising to dreary daily and there is election on the horizon.  The stock could continue to be a high flyer or come crashing down based on any of those factors.  For the sake of argument, lets say the difference in the tax bill between STCG and LTCG is $20K.  

Lets talk about options for protecting this position while maximizing tax savings:

1. Conservative Approach - Sell now, pocket the money but pay STCG - this has an opportunity cost of $20K (the difference between STCG and LTCG)
2. Buy ""insurance"" to protect against a significant drop in price - Buying March 2021 ""puts"" at the current strike price to cover the position will cost about $500. If the price stays the same or goes up, the put expires worthless and I loose $500 but avoid paying the $20K STCG/LTCG differential.   
This seems like a no-brainer way to protect a position long enough to recover the tax differential.
   1.  Not so fast!  It turns out the options trade itself has the same STCG/LTCG problem if it makes money.  So, if the position drops by $100K and I exercise the put, the position is protected, but I owe STCG (.35) on the $100K gain from the put.  
3. Plan for significant volatility -  Setting up a March 2021 options straddle   (buying puts and calls at the current strike price) will cost approximately $1000, but it has the benefit of protecting the position in the event of a huge decline and providing even more exposure to a big price increase. If price stays the same, but the put and all expire worthless and I am out $1K (still significantly better than the $20K differential)
   1. Again I will have a STCG problem on the option itself

,investing,"I read an article that claimed that Bitcoin tended to lead stocks market changes, but this was the usual tea leaf reading and chart-staring.

So I decided to compute the cross-correlation function of daily bitcoin percentage changes with SP500 daily percentage changes, from 2015 to today.

Plot here: https://i.imgur.com/zNHSzZK.png

The big white peak shows that bitcoin and stocks move in parallel on the same day (zero time lag).

But the broad bump in the red boxcar-smoothed correlation function suggests that bitcoin prices changes today are correlated with SP500 changes over the upcoming week.   

However the SP500 seems to have little or no predictive power for Bitcoin, because there's no peak to the left of zero.


---- 

NOTE: the [cross-correlation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) is defined as  

c(t) = ∫ 𝝙BTC(𝜏 )/BTC((𝜏 ) ⨉ 𝝙SP500(𝜏 +t)/SP500(𝜏 +t)d𝜏   

so that if BTC(𝜏 ) tends move the same as SP500(𝜏+t) for many  𝜏 then c(t) should have a peak at t.

-----

edit - a simple hypothesis:  The zero-lag (white) correlation is obviously just normal correlated markets. The longer (red) correlation represents an internal lag time to the stock market in responding to events.  For example a negative event causes a crash in both BTC and SP500.  The Bitcoin falls fast, and stops, but SP500 reacts slowly and the sell-off  takes a few days to complete.    

As an analogy, an earthquake knocks down a building (BTC), and also sets off a huge landslide (SP500), but the big landslide tends to be followed by a series of smaller landslides.     The building's fall ""predicted"" the multi-day landslide, but it's not a useful prediction, because you could have looked at the initial landslide and known that more landslides tend to follow.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funny Woke CEO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The engineering elite of Silicon Valley may know more than most about building software. But they do not know more about how society should be organized or what justice requires. Our company was founded in Silicon Valley. But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector’s values and commitments. From the start, we have repeatedly turned down opportunities to sell, collect, or mine data. Other technology companies, including some of the largest in the world, have built their entire businesses on doing just that. Software projects with our nation’s defense and intelligence agencies, whose missions are to keep us safe, have become controversial, while companies built on advertising dollars are commonplace. For many consumer internet companies, our thoughts and inclinations, behaviors and browsing habits, are the product for sale. The slogans and marketing of many of the Valley’s largest technology firms attempt to obscure this simple fact.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. consumer confidence fell for second straight month in August as households worried about the economic outlook.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 84.8 this month from 91.7 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to a reading of 93 in August.

Despite its high valuation, Morgan Stanley analysts are still bullish on Apple, raising its price target for the stock to $520 per share from $431—now the highest of any major Wall Street firm, according to FactSet. 

At 25x free cash flow, “Apple trades at a discount to both tech platforms and strong consumer brands,” Morgan Stanley’s note said.


The analysts point out that Apple’s free cash flow has grown more than 20% annually over the last four years, despite a slowdown in iPhone sales: “These results underscore the strength of Apple’s broad ecosystem of products and services, a change from past years where Apple was more reliant on the success of the iPhone to drive growth.””

,investing,"Goldman hosted a virtual investor meeting yesterday with $DAL\* CEO Ed Bastian and CFO Paul Jacobson. The discussions focused on demand recovery and the company's ability to adapt costs to the uncertain demand outlook. Here are the key takeaways:

1. Commenting on the current demand environment, management noted that this has held relatively steady at down \~75% year-over-year for the last four to six weeks, underlying which business demand remains down a more depressed -86% to -88% year-over-year. However, more recently the company has seen a very modest uptick in bookings, likely driven in part by the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend. Given that bookings remain relatively close-in, the company does not currently have much clarity around fall demand, but expects to have a better view post-Labor Day.
2. Due to ongoing demand uncertainty, the company remains committed to its flexible planning approach. Currently, Delta’s planning guardrails are for summer 2021 capacity to be down 20% to 40% vs. 2019 levels. If the demand recovery by summer 2021 requires a capacity cut of greater than 40%, the company believes there is room to flex down further. However, if demand were to recover in a more V-shaped fashion than most airline managements and we believe is likely, it would be difficult for Delta to cut capacity less than 20% given previously announced headcount reductions and aircraft retirements.
3. Delta anticipates that its unit costs (“CASM”) coming out of the crisis will be lower than pre-COVID levels given various cost savings across the organization, including labor and the fleet. On the former, the company highlighted that 17,000 employees, or \~20% of its workforce, have already elected to participate in voluntary retirement/separation programs. The majority of participants in these programs were more senior and therefore at the higher end of the pay scale, which should result in lower labor costs even as Delta/the industry scale back up as demand recovers, further aided by productivity gains the company is planning to leverage. With respect to fleet-driven savings, management highlighted its previously announced aircraft retirement plans would accelerate its fleet simplification process and reduce expenses going forward tied to improved fuel burn, fewer training events, reduced spare parts inventory, etc.
4. With Delta planning for both capacity and costs to be down \~50% year-over-year in the Dec Q, the company continues to anticipate that further cash burn improvement will largely hinge on demand. However, management commented that potential further fleet simplification actions could drive additional costs out of the business.
5. Delta reiterated that it does not currently plan to draw on its loan allocation under the current CARES Act given the associated restrictions and as it has other options to raise additional liquidity if necessary. Looking forward, there have been discussions of a potential airline provision in a new proposed stimulus package (or “CARES 2”), which could include an extension of the Payroll Support Program (currently slated to end September 30th). Management noted that these discussions, which started out as a union-driven initiative, have bipartisan support in the US government and that a relatively larger CARES 2 package would increase the likelihood of the airlines provision being included.
6. Management currently does not plan to back away from its long-standing strategy to strengthen its global network through partnerships with various international airlines.

So what is stop-loss insurance? Basically it protects employers from unexpected and large employee healthcare costs  - obviously this is inspired by the current ongoing pandemic. This is quite attractive for self-funded employers, who often don't have the money reserved to deal with unexpected health crisis.

I'm sure covid-19 won't be the last pandemic that the world will face (in fact, Bill Gates has warned us for years about this). So the incentive to protect  business from current and future health crisis will only get bigger. And with the immense Google tech backing it, Coefficient Insurance can easily tailor its insurance policy to meet the need/risk of each employer.

I believe this is the right move for Google given the current circumstance and the rising hype about online data-driven insurance-related business (ie,  LMND and DCT). So I expect more upside to Google stock in the near future.

Sales of newly built homes soared across the nation in July, as pent-up demand from the shutdown spring market, urban flight and a new desire for more work-at-home space fueled the growth.

As measured by signed contracts, new home sales jumped 13.9% compared with June and were a remarkable 36.3% higher annually, according to the U.S. Census. June’s reading was also revised higher. This is the strongest one-month pace since 2006.

This is the third consecutive month of sizable sales gains, after sales dropped dramatically in March and April, due to the onset of the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/coronavirus-live-updates.html). 

Strong demand sucked up the inventory of newly built homes for sale, which fell to a four-month supply from a 4.7-month supply in June. 

“The new home market has everything going for it right now including limited resale supply, fear of missing out, heightened dissatisfaction of our current living situation, low mortgage rates, months of saving money, and increased demand from key demographic cohorts,” said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Meyers Research.

Low supply and strong demand made it easier for builders to raise prices. The median price of a newly built home sold in July was $330,600, an increase of 7.2% compared with July 2019.

“With larger homes, greener backyards, garages and home offices ranking at the top of home buyers’ lists, new homes in the suburbs fit the bill and have been a welcome answer to a housing market parched for existing inventory,” said George Ratiu, senior economist at realtor.com. “Builders have recognized the acute need for more construction and have moved to fill the gap. The main concern hovering over the market is whether the rising costs of building materials will drive prices even higher.”

Lumber prices are up more than 100% since mid-April, as mills shut down in the spring and did not expect to see such strong demand so quickly. There are also higher tariffs on imports of lumber.

Buyers are taking advantage of low mortgage rates, which give them additional purchasing power but also tend to juice home prices. The average rate on the 30-year fixed set two record lows in July, when these sales contracts were signed.

Regionally, sales gains were strongest in the Midwest and the South but dropped in the Northeast on a monthly basis. The Northeast tends to be the most volatile read, as it has the smallest concentration of new construction.

BigCommerce merchants can be among the  first  to adopt the new feature, which provides shoppers an intuitive,   seamless and secure way to purchase products they discover on Instagram   in a few clicks, without leaving the app.

Leveraging   BigCommerce’s native integration with Facebook Commerce Manager,   merchants can easily connect their ecommerce storefront’s catalog to   Instagram and give customers the ability to buy from their favorite   brands directly on Instagram—rather than navigating to a brand’s website   to make a purchase—and pay using PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, American   Express or Discover. After placing an order, customers can also use the   Instagram app to view their order status, estimated delivery date and   tracking number, as well as cancel orders, initiate returns or request   additional support.

""Creating  a  streamlined checkout experience is paramount for merchants looking to   social commerce to drive revenue growth.

If Powell has his way, he will try to increase inflation to something like 4-5% to stimulate the economy

The way to increase inflation is that 

1. treasury creates bonds, 

2. treasury sells them to banks, (banks make profit on interest), 

3. they sell the bonds to banks, 

4. the  feds  write a cheque, 

5. the banks then get treasury to print more money while cashing in their cheques.

Because I did that, I'm now on their free newsletter as well, and they started REALLY hyping this thing they were calling the SuperBull Summit where he was going to talk about his strategies for picking stocks that will make massive gains over the coming years. They kept sending out reminders about this event for over a week so I decided to watch it to see if it had anything good to say. I don't know how heavily attended it was, so maybe none of you know what I'm talking about.

Anyway, it turns out that it was just an hour-long advertisement for another one of his advising packages called ""Extreme Fortunes"" to which he offered a small discount and a meaningless guarantee... He did however talk about a handful of stocks that he thinks are going to be huge winners over the coming years including one that he said he has never been more bullish on. He didn't mention what they actually are because he wants you to buy his service, but I wanted to see if we could reason out what they were based on what he said.

I'm not sure if it will work or not, but the topics I'm bringing up are at 1:06:26-1:12:20 (for the #1 stock he thinks will go up over 1000% in the coming years) and 1:13:44-1:15:58 (for his other 5 stocks he anticipates acting similarly).

In addition to that though, he was pretty vague about 5 other stocks. I took a screenshot ([link](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Mjdw991DE1y5LirXA)) of the description for the 5 companies. I'm wondering if we can decode which companies he is thinking of. Here is what he said about each one that isn't on the image:

1. Breakthrough for continuous glucose monitoring with minimal maintenance for consumers. Technology is 12x more resilient than competitors. Has received financing from Blackrock and Oppenheimer. Priced at ""almost nothing right now.""
2. Twice the effectiveness of competitors in atrial fibrillation treatment. In the last few years, revenue has more than quadrupled.

Because I did that, I&amp;#39;m now on their free newsletter as well, and they started REALLY hyping this thing they were calling the SuperBull Summit where he was going to talk about his strategies for picking stocks that will make massive gains over the coming years. They kept sending out reminders about this event for over a week so I decided to watch it to see if it had anything good to say. I don&amp;#39;t know how heavily attended it was, so maybe none of you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that it was just an hour-long advertisement for another one of his advising packages called &amp;quot;Extreme Fortunes&amp;quot; to which he offered a small discount and a meaningless guarantee... He did however talk about a handful of stocks that he thinks are going to be huge winners over the coming years including one that he said he has never been more bullish on. He didn&amp;#39;t mention what they actually are because he wants you to buy his service, but I wanted to see if we could reason out what they were based on what he said.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m not sure if it will work or not, but the topics I&amp;#39;m bringing up are at 1:06:26-1:12:20 (for the #1 stock he thinks will go up over 1000% in the coming years) and 1:13:44-1:15:58 (for his other 5 stocks he anticipates acting similarly). Don&amp;#39;t watch the rest, it&amp;#39;s a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m nearly positive that his #1 stock is AXTI because the costs match up, the CEO matches his description, and they sell the same products he mentions. I bought $300 of it, we&amp;#39;ll see what happens. Do what you will with that info.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that though, he was pretty vague about 5 other stocks. I took a screenshot (&lt;a href=""https://photos.app.goo.gl/Mjdw991DE1y5LirXA""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) of the description for the 5 companies. I&amp;#39;m wondering if we can decode which companies he is thinking of. Here is what he said about each one that isn&amp;#39;t on the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breakthrough for continuous glucose monitoring with minimal maintenance for consumers. Technology is 12x more resilient than competitors. Has received financing from Blackrock and Oppenheimer. Priced at &amp;quot;almost nothing right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twice the effectiveness of competitors in atrial fibrillation treatment. In the last few years, revenue has more than quadrupled.&lt;/li&gt;

,investing,"Hey everyone, I recently got this options strategy from this company based in the US called the Nanban Foundation. It seems very promising, but it took a while to understand it (the English was a bit broken). I managed to translate it, and I need help evaluating this. From my rough calculations it seems this can make around 100-170 dollars a week with the initial investment being 2000 dollars. That would mean an average return of about 260% to 440%!!!. I think this might be too good to be true. Please let me know what you guys think!

Anyway, here it is:

This is for SPY STOCK (S&amp;P 500)

1. SELL a PUT (with a strike at 5 dollars above the current market price of SPY) and SELL a CALL (with a strike at 5 dollars below the current market price of SPY) both for a Premium ($X)

2. BUY a PUT for a premium of 20% of $X

3. BUY a CALL for a premium of 10% of $X

4. Create CLOSING ORDERS for Step 1 by spending 10% of $X. For example, If $X=1.00, create a CLOSING ORDER for when the SELL PUT and SELL CALL’s premium reaches 0.90.

5. Create a CLOSING ORDER for Step 2 when the premium quadruples.

6. Create a CLOSING ORDER for Step 3 when the premium doubles or quadruples.

7. If the CLOSING ORDER for step 5 executes, repeat steps 2, 5, 7 except when repeating step 2, you have to do it for a premium of 20% of the premium of the EXECUTED CLOSING ORDER. If not, disregard this step.

8. If the CLOSING ORDER for step 6 executes, repeat steps 3, 6, 8 except when repeating step 3, you have to do it for a premium of 10% of the premium of the EXECUTED CLOSING ORDER. If not, disregard this step.

Interested in any feedback from investors who have a decent portion of their wealth in cryptocurrency and are utilizing DeFi. If you're not familiar with the term, in the crypto money community, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) encompasses sets of protocols which fill the roles of a central bank. An entire ""crypto banking"" layer has evolved on top of assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that allow users to:

(a) Remain in full control &amp; possession of their assets by utilizing offline storage &amp; hardware wallets.  
(b) Allow for lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest on crypto assets.

I think it's apparent—in the US at least—that there's really no intrinsic value to the dollar, most people do not have money, simply currency. I can't help but feel that between public awareness of how markets work, COVID, extreme partisanship in government and a calculated effort by the Federal Reserve to devalue the $USD through QE that soon the bubble is going to burst, and it's time to pay the piper. The magnitude of the $USD collapse would be catastrophic for anyone left holding the bag (most people).

Is there anyone who has a large share of their wealth in cryptocurrency that has tested the waters of DeFi?

I am particularly interested in feedback from those who have placed a good portion of their net worth into crypto banking systems, actively taking part in lending, asset pools, governance, or any other ""bankless"" financial system. Understanding that this whole sector is far from mature:

* Has anything struck you as being a major flaw in the setup of crypto banking as it stands?
* Do you feel (assuming proper precautions of utilizing hardware wallets/key ownership are followed) that your assets are as secure within DeFi systems as they are just being held in your wallet?
* With maturation, do you believe DeFi will surpass traditional markets?

Just getting started looking into moving cryptocurrency holdings into DeFi systems, so any and all constructive advice would be appreciated!

STOR was bought again by Berkshire, which is a keen sign of confidence.

GOOD and MAIN I know less about. GOOD runs long term leases for factories and office buildings (I know). They did seem to pull out of the last recession very well.

,investing,"I’m a complete noob who started learning about options trading like a couple days ago, so please bear with me if I say something stupid.

I know that with an iron condor strategy you make money when the price of the underlying stock is greater than the short put strike - premium and less than the short call strike + premium.

Let’s say that the value of the underlying stock falls outside that range before expiration—we mitigate our loss using a buy call and buy put with the iron condor strategy. But in the end we still suffer a set loss.

My question is, can we avoid that loss by setting close orders for the buy calls and buy puts that activate when the premiums of those contracts increase buy 4 times and then just setting up a new buy call/put for a premium for the same price as the initial buy put and call?

For example, let’s say the value of XYZ stock is 75 dollars at the beginning of the iron condor trade. Then we engage in an iron condor trade with a BUY 60 PUT @ 1.00, SELL 65 PUT @ 2.00, SEL 85 CALL @ 2.00, BUY 90 CALL @ 1.00. After a few days, let’s say that the price of the XYZ stock is increasing more than we expect and it’s approaching 90. What if we just close the BUY 90 CALL option before XYZ hits the strike price of the BUY 90 CALL and then immediately enter a BUY 95 CALL?

Through this method, I think we would be able to completely remove any loss. But I feel like this is too good to be true. Is there a catch to this method?

# U.S. Poised to Charge Teva in Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe

Aug. 25, 2020, 2:16 PM

U.S. prosecutors are preparing to charge Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. with conspiring with competitors to raise prices for generic drugs, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Justice Department is planning to charge Teva as soon as Tuesday after the company rebuffed a settlement that would have required paying a criminal penalty and admitting wrongdoing, said the person, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.

A spokesperson for Teva, which is based in Israel, declined to comment.

# Drug firm bets it won't be charged

In the coming days, the Justice Department will decide whether to file criminal charges against one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies suspected of colluding with rivals to inflate the prices of widely used drugs.

The company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, is betting that in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the Trump administration won't dare to come down hard on the largest supplier of generic drugs in the United States.

It is a high-stakes gamble that could affect millions of Americans who rely on Teva's dozens of inexpensive generic drugs, as well as its brand-name products like Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis, and Ajovy, for migraines. Teva officials say criminal charges could cripple the Israeli company and potentially leave it unable to sell drugs to federal programs like Medicare.

For years, the Justice Department and state prosecutors have been investigating what they describe as a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies to increase the prices of popular drugs. The department has already extracted guilty pleas and $224 million in penalties from four other drug companies.

Lawyers for Teva, which prosecutors believe was deeply involved in the conspiracy, until recently had been holding settlement negotiations with officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division. But in April, the company all but walked away from the talks, according to people on both sides of the discussions.",t2_112r0h,False,,0,False,ALERT -- TEVA Charged For Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_igibr1,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,1598385013.0,,[],{},,True,,1598409877.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run for your life ...&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I've been calculating FCF follows: 

FCF = Net Income - CapEx

Which seems to be the accepted equation. 

However, I recently came across a BioTech company which has negative Cash From Investing (all of which comes under the section Investments). 

Why is this not included in the calculation of FCF? Surely if they spent more cash on investments than they earned back, this loss affects their FCF?

The company in question has no CapEx or PP&amp;E on their Cash Flow statement.

So what does ""Investments"" actually entail in this case? Securities? I'm not sure why the company would be spending cash on securities rather than capital.  On the balance sheet, the majority of their assets are short-term investments. Is this normal in BioTech?

,investing,"Hey everyone, my friend and I are very into stocks. We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” &gt; “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock (useful for Rate My Portfolio).
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

We hope this is helpful!

,investing,"**TLDR at the bottom**

As the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.

**Objective:**

SOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is ""focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.""

**Opinion:**

I believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.

**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency

**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards

**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards

SOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))

**Opinion:**

Whether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:

**Objective:**

What type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as ""manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others."" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.

**Opinion:**

Think about some of the ""hot"" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.

Many people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.

Based on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its ""hype"" or its ""meme/moon potential""). I can see that happening with SOAC.

Speaking of the management team...

**Objective:**

CEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard

CFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT

Chairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota

**Opinion:**

Good mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.

Based on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.

**Objective:**

SOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20

**Opinion:**

SOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.

**Objective:**

SOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))

**Opinion:**

The timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.

What that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.

**Final thoughts:**

SOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.

**Disclaimer:**

I have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.

**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",t2_6j4na0aj,False,,0,False,"Opinion: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) is a possible value sector to target for investing in the near future.

,investing,"Hi, I have a dummy question about bonds / fixed income.

Stock / equity, I understand - if I invest $10k into Stock, it goes up or down, I gain / lose money accordingly. Got it.

Bonds on the other hand - if I invest $10k into Bonds, are the following assumptions true?

(i) It pays a certain coupon rate semi-annually which defines my yield - ie, the rate of return - let's say 4.0%

(ii) but there's also the ""mark to market"" or ""valuation"" component similar to Stocks - ie, the value of my Bonds (ie what people / the open market will pay for it) may increase or decrease as the interest rate (say the 3/5/10 year treasury yields) move down or up. Does this also get factored into my ""rate of return""? And consequently making me sensitive to interest rate risk?

Broadly, I'm just trying to figure out - if my $10k investment into a some sort of a bond index fund 5 years ago is now worth $12k, is that a combination of (i) and (ii) above? And similarly, if that investment is now worth only $9k, can I effectively assume that the yield I earned on (i) was more than offset by the losses incurred by (ii)?

&lt;p&gt;Stock / equity, I understand - if I invest $10k into Stock, it goes up or down, I gain / lose money accordingly. Got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds on the other hand - if I invest $10k into Bonds, are the following assumptions true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(i) It pays a certain coupon rate semi-annually which defines my yield - ie, the rate of return - let&amp;#39;s say 4.0%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ii) but there&amp;#39;s also the &amp;quot;mark to market&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;valuation&amp;quot; component similar to Stocks - ie, the value of my Bonds (ie what people / the open market will pay for it) may increase or decrease as the interest rate (say the 3/5/10 year treasury yields) move down or up.

,investing,"Fairly new trader/investor, been swing trading and trading options for the past 4 months.

Been looking into ETFs and dividend stocks as i think they would give more of a return than my .05% savings account...

I was wondering how covered calls work with dividends however, i haven't found a straightforward answer.

I own 100 shares of XOM.

I sell covered calls each week to increase my return.

What happens if:

1. I sell my call before the ex-dividend date and it hits the strike and i lose my shares
2. I sell my call after the ex-dividend date and it hits the strike and i lose my shares

Im pretty sure if i sell calls before or after and they expire, ill still get my dividend but i was curious how losing them works.

Im also imagining if i sell puts before purchasing the stock, i just need to actually own 100 shares before the ex-dividend date, and then switch to covered calls until the dividend date passes?

,investing,"
I've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.

I'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.

Reasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):

* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&amp;P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.
* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).
* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&amp;P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.
* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write ""hello world"" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.
* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.

Reasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)

* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.
* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.
* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.
* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of ""eyeballs"".
* (opinion) ""this time is different"". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger ""paradigm shift"" than what we are seeing today. I used ""paradigm shift"", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).
* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).
* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&amp;P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&amp;P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.

You can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.

I'll end with a few random thoughts:

* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.
* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario.

I just turned 17, I work making ~600 dollars a month part time

I have another 5000 in the bank right now which I probably will put into a Roth IRA, investing in some growth stocks I guess? Completely tax free :). Haven’t totally thought that part through 100% yet so not sure about what investments I will pursue there 
And then I have another $500 of just money in cash and on my debit card 
I’ve always been really into finance, followed stocks and researched them since end of middle school. In the future I want to be a financial manager for a company I think, but still have a very open mind on what I want to do. Starting a. Business seems cool too but very daunting to me.

I feel like I’ve been pretty fortunate, I save almost all the money I receive which is part of the reason I have a decent amount saved up
Also, any other sort of things I can be investing in besides stocks that are worthwhile and good investments?

,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,1,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,268,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,268,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn&amp;#39;t an appropriate subreddit for that.  We&amp;#39;re here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;/r/investing&lt;/a&gt; is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that the guidelines are made clear, here&amp;#39;s the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we&amp;#39;re automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we&amp;#39;re not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren&amp;#39;t already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Corporate vs Investment News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/crasymike""&gt;/u/crasymike&lt;/a&gt; did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they&amp;#39;re in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can&amp;#39;t incite relevant discussion in every topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you include no relevant investing information then don&amp;#39;t be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can&amp;#39;t figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn&amp;#39;t include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn&amp;#39;t link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is &amp;quot;borderline&amp;quot; not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn&amp;#39;t investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"""The generation to generation improvement in performance, coupled with flat generation to generation pricing trends, implies an increase in performance/$ that is larger on the Ampere generation of cards than the Turing generation. Recall that based on data provided at Nvidia's various Investor Days, 98% of Nvidia's installed base was on Pascal (introduced in 2016) or older generation cards entering 2019.

,investing,"For many years, I have been an advocate of the Three-Fund Portfolio and, in general, the Boglehead approach to investing.  Roughly 90% of my portfolio still exists in this format, with an allocation of 61% domestic, 14% international, and 25% bond.

Recently, I built up a model of all of my finances:

* ""static"" expenses (things that don't increase over time, like mortgage payments, student loan payments, and auto payments)
* ""dynamic"" expense (those that do increase over time with inflation, like daycare, property tax, and the electric bill
* Income, with a metric for annual increases
* Investments, with allocation, historical yield, and standard deviation

All of this was set to answer the question: ""When am I likely to be able to retire?""  The finish line would be based on the logic: 25 times the amount of ($100,000/year inflation adjusted plus any remaining ""static"" expenses).  So if the mortgage was the only expense left and you pay $50k a year on that, my target would be $150k * 25 = $3,750,000.  That allows me to pull 4% per year more or less forever.

The model was run on a monthly basis, proceeding until the mark is hit, stores the retirement age, and then repeats 10,000 times.  Each month, the monthly return is calculated for each investment vehicle by generating a normally distributed random number, multiplying that by the fund's standard deviation, and adding it to the weighted mean return.  In this way, I include all of the random walk of the market.

When putting in the numbers, something drastic stood out to me:

Fund|Annual Return|Standard Deviation
:-:|:-:|:-:
Domestic|7.84%|19.48%
International|4.27%|15.20%
Bond|5.28%|3.07%

Why the hell do I have any money in the international fund?  While not a ""complete"" data set, the International Fund source data is back to 1996, so it's a reasonable 24-year sample.  Yields are lower than bonds, with standard deviation 5x as high.

Where's the benefit?  ""Diversification"" by itself is a rough answer, especially given the weight that the US Market has on foreign markets.

,investing,"I’ve been debating about switching from VIOO into VIOV to capture the size effect and the value premium. It’s been shown that small cap value tends to outperform any other stock asset class over the long term. But the last 10 years or so have been horrible for value investors. I know past performance doesn’t indicate anything for the future, but 10 years of underperformance is horrible if your investment horizon to really grow your wealth is 30 - 40 years.

Why not just hold a blended fund to guarantee yourself you will capture the size effect and not make any effort to tilt one way towards value or growth?

But if you bet on only value and it does poorly, you’ll suffer. I’ve heard small cap, low profitability, growth, has tended to reduce the size effect, but hasn’t value done that for the last decade?

However, interesting, if there are many negative days in a row, does TQQQ seems to do better than QQQ

In general the legal wording make it difficult and time consuming to decipher

For example the latest tender offer from Ponos to owners of AT&amp;T (ticker: T) where it sounds like they are offering a premium of 20% ($36 compared to current price $30) but researching further I found below article clarifying that accepting the offer can only lead to loss because it will only take effect if the price is above $36 when it expires...

&lt;li&gt;Why are mini-offers like above with guaranteed loss even legal?

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digging deeper it seems that Ponos has done the exact same on Exxon, Visa, GE, Oracle and Verizon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

They have impressive improvements in sintering, heating/extruding, and throughput, and they appear to be the best in the business.

China is planning a sweeping set of new government policies to develop its domestic semiconductor industry and counter Trump administration restrictions, conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Beijing is preparing broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors for the five years through 2025, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing government deliberations. A suite of measures to bolster research, education and financing for the industry has been added to a draft of the country’s 14th five-year plan, which will be presented to the country’s top leaders in October, the people said.


China’s top leaders will gather next month to lay out their economic strategy for the next half decade, including efforts to ramp up domestic consumption and make critical technology at home. President Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to artificial intelligence. Semiconductors are fundamental to virtually every component of China’s technology ambitions -- and an increasingly aggressive Trump administration threatens to cut off their supply from abroad.

“The Chinese leadership realizes that semiconductors underpin all advanced technologies, and that it can no longer dependably rely on American supplies,” said Dan Wang, technology analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. “In the face of stricter U.S. restrictions on chip access, China’s response can only be to keep pushing its own industry to develop.”

How do you see this affecting the semiconductor industry? Will China just buy their own chips or is this too ambitious?

Apple's Market Cap as of right now is 2.3 Trillion ([Source](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap)). On August 20, it was 2 Trillion. It has added 300 billion in about 10 days - without having added any products what soever (primarily due to the stock split).

In April of this year, it was 1.1 Trillion or so. It has since doubled since that time, so much so that it is the size of the GDP of France ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/))

They have crazy high margins and once a consumer buys an Apple device, he has to buy other ones due to the seamless integration it provides (biggest selling point). It is now getting in more markets such as India with its' new iPhone SE 2, but I am somewhat skeptical on its' valuation.

I feel like people are buying AAPL due to its security - it has always gone up, so it will always go up - and therefore, it's safe to park their money there. Some are even likening it to Treasury Bonds - that it's better to put your money in AAPL stock because it's *safe* and because it's so big, it won't fail.

Stocks rose on Wednesday, continuing a strong start to September for the market as traders took profits out of high-flying names like Apple and Tesla and snapped up shares in more beaten-down parts of the market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 300 points, or 1%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1% while the Nasdaq Composite was higher by 0.5%. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, with the Nasdaq topping 12,000 for the first time. 

Coca-Cola rose more than 3% along with IBM to lead the Dow higher. However, both of those stocks are still down year to date. Apple and Tesla slid 2.6% and 6.5%, respectively, giving back some of their recently sharp gains. The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) rose 1.1% to outperform its Growth counterpart.

Wall Street was coming off a banner session in which the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 also logged in its best first trading day of September since 2010, according to Bespoke Investment Group. 

Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Mike Wilson said Tuesday on “[Closing Bell](https://www.cnbc.com/closing-bell/)” that he was still optimistic about the market long-term but that weakness in the weeks ahead was on the table after such a strong rally.

,investing,"The recommendation is to have a strong mix of US stock and international stock in your overall portfolio. The percentages can differ, but it is a fairly common to have both. Some argue that having a pure US stock index is already pretty diversified because many companies within an index such as the S&amp;P are international companies and in-directly related.

I want to draw the comparison visually, but having a tough time picking funds that can illustrate that point.

Ride-hailing firm Uber has stepped up lobbying of the Hong Kong government after losing a critical court case on the legality of its business model, with some drivers vowing to keep carrying passengers despite the threat of an intensified crackdown.
In a letter to stakeholders, legislators and other policymakers on Tuesday, Uber’s local head of public policy and government affairs called on them to use their influence to persuade the government to change its stance on the company.
“As we face this critical and uncertain period, I hope that we can continue to count on your support so that Uber and our partners can carry on serving the millions of Hongkongers who rely on our apps,” Richard Wilder said.
“There are different ways that individuals can support Uber at this point, either by raising the issue with relevant stakeholders as you see fit or by submitting to the chief executive’s policy address consultation directly.”

The plea came after the Court of Final Appeal on Tuesday threw out the last-ditch bids of 24 Uber drivers who were found guilty of carrying passengers for hire or reward without a hire-car permit, and were fined between HK$3,000 (US$380) and HK$4,500 in 2018.
The defeat was a devastating blow to Uber, which has provided millions of trips to residents since arriving in 2014, as well as delivering food orders.
“We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision, and we will continue to support the 24 partners and their families during this challenging time,” Wilder said.

The senior executive admitted the top court’s ruling, coupled with a lack of regulatory progress on ride-sharing in Hong Kong, had “profound consequences” for Uber and the 14,000 active drivers who hoped to find flexible earning opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic.

“We know that the single most common reason for becoming a driver-partner is to make up for lost income during the current economic crisis, with the second most important reason being the need to meet ongoing obligations to support their families,” Wilder said.

\-This was an earnings play, based off the theory that ZM would push more of these ""Covid beneficiary"" stocks. Although they have nothing in common, pet sales sky-rocketed this spring, so online pet food sales were bound to follow.

SalesForce (CRM); bought a $5.90/270 call for September 11th. Sold for 14.30  
\-This was a momentum play, and one I do quite often. I had done a similar 300% trade last week, playing it off earnings. Healthy consolidation and bull volume keep this stock in a safe uptrend.

CrowdStrike (CRWD); I had bought two calls for this play, based on the pop Monday morning. Just like other Covid stocks, CRWD had momentum leading into its earnings date. Bought a $6.30/150 call for September 11th that I sold for $16.05. The other call is a long dated, out of the money, play that I will keep you updated on!

*The Fed now “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,” rather than 2% inflation as a fixed goal. What this means in practice is that:*

*“following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”*

When FED announced unlimited QE in mid-march, I didn't understand the implication of that and was still expecting for further market crash and reduced amount of my monthly investment. So would like to avoid the same mistake and analyze and discuss the implication of this major policy shift better.

Questions

1. Does this policy shift of allowing inflation higher than 2 % mean stocks are going to appreciate much more than expected before? Does this mean its prudent to invest now than wait for another corona related crash/Nov election crash?
2. What is the impact of this policy shift on other asset classes like bonds, metals etc compared to stocks?

The Food and Drug Administration recommended Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch hire a consultant to help the generic drugmaker improve its manufacturing practices, according to an Aug. 20 warning letter released Tuesday.

The FDA inspected Mylan’s facility in Pashamylaram, India, in February.

The agency found that the plant, which makes active ingredients for drugs, hadn’t taken the proper precautions to ensure solvents it used didn’t contain impurities, including failing to adequately test the raw materials.

FDA inspectors reported that Mylan’s testing found signs of impurities in its solvents but that the company failed to investigate further.

Mylan said in a statement that it had been working with the FDA since last fall to thoroughly investigate potential risks associated with inquiries related to impurities.

That said, we think that there is little incremental today vs. what the stock has been embedding after the initial run up in July, and the near-term direction of the stock will depend on comps and relative traffic trends due to the impact from unique COVID-related factors as detailed a couple weeks ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ultimately, the main value in the offering seems to be the speed of home delivery... Missing from this program is free shipping (next day/two day) with no threshold on the broader and growing online assortment, a key value of Prime and a feature that ranked high in our survey (number two, right behind free same day grocery).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In that context, one key factor will be breadth of general merchandise SKU’s available for this same day option, to make it competitive vs. Prime.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Initial interest in our July survey showed 61% of respondents said “yes” or “maybe” to subscribing to Walmart+, and 70% within the 18-44 age cohort.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jefferies:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;We remain pos. on WMT&amp;#39;s now official Walmart+ subscription offering as it helps tie together WMT&amp;#39;s omni-channel efforts and is progress towards a legit ecosystem (TikTok would help) w/ a strong physical footprint that is increasingly competitive vs. AMZN. Today&amp;#39;s announcement is largely in line with expectations, but we expect add&amp;#39;l benefits to come in the next few qtrs. N-T EBIT could take a hit on investment, but we see considerable L-T val. expansion oppty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

It's clear that in markets that trend sideways with lots of volatility the end result is a net negative for levered ETFs.  It's usually argued that overtime this decay will gradually erode the value of the investment. However, back testing a levered version of the S&amp;P500 seems to show otherwise (assuming a 1% expense ratio):

By doing so they were able to reduce volatility and improve return.

Are you a risk-lover or are you risk-averse? Why does anyone take a risk in financial investments?

I have seen many day traders and investors proudly advertise themselves as ‘risk-takers’.

Is that really something to boast about? Not to throw shade on their profitable trading and investment strategies but why does anyone take risk?

Let’s say you want to grow your wealth. How would you do that?

A. Invest in your education / network and get a high-paying job.

B. Take a risk on your existing wealth to get a 10% return (profit) or a 5% loss (assuming a conservative risk-reward ratio of 1:2)

Option B is often touted as ‘passive income’ whereas Option A is touted as ‘Active income’ aka ‘hard-earned money’. Which one is the better option? Would you conserve your ‘hard-earned money’ or would you risk it to earn a little more pocket money?

,investing,"Based on sales and demand data from more than 17 million members and millions of items sold, the report charts the current state of luxury resale and COVID-19’s impact on what consumers are buying and selling.

Sales growth of high-value items, across numerous categories, outpaced that of low-value:

-**High-value jewelry sales grew 22x more than low-value**

-**High-value handbag sales grew 2.4x more than low-value**

-**High-value watch sales grew 6x more than low-value**

For the second year in a row, Gucci and Louis Vuitton remain the most in-demand brands within luxury resale. Louis Vuitton edged its way over Gucci for the No. 1 spot for the first time, while Gucci remains the No. 1 Men’s brand for the third year in a row. Driven by a surge in demand for millennials and Gen Z, both brands continued to strengthen their lead over No. 3 brand Chanel.

“In a bright spot during these difficult times, brands, shoppers and consignors alike are engaging in the circular economy,” said Rati Levesque, COO and head of merchandising for The RealReal. “Gen Z, millennials and men are the new faces of luxury shopping, and the brands in tune with what they want are rising to the top.”

Other trends that rose to the top during COVID-19*:

**Stealth luxury favored over logomania:**

-Demand for understated handbags was nearly 5x stronger than that of statement handbags

-Sales for quieter men’s styles grew 2.4x more than statement styles

**Buyers embrace luxury labels’ streetwear designs:**

-Balenciaga becomes No. 1 brand in streetwear

-Demand for luxury streetwear spiked 486 percent in the past two years

**Buyers and sellers turn to Home/Art like never before:**

-Art consignment was up 150%

-Customers spent 26 percent more on home items compared to apparel, quarter-over-quarter

As brick-and-mortar came to a standstill, brands and retailers turned to luxury resale to connect with buyers and give new life to pieces past and present – **interest increased 22x during COVID-19.**

-New consignors during COVID-19* increased 27 percent, of which 37 percent were **millennials and Gen Z.**

,investing,"I come to r/investing hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it. I understand my post isn’t is not the typical r/investing post, but my post is meant to hopefully explain some things the r/investing crowd may not have heavy exposure to, which is options and how they are having a massive effect on certain stocks, particularly Tesla. 

So to begin with, I see way too many posts like P/E of stock XYZ is too high. Tesla is one of these XYZ stocks, but the market has changed. No one really cares about P/E anymore. All that matters is supply and demand and especially through options. Unfortunately, because of retail, the entire options market has changed the last few months, which probably changed the behavior of funds too, causing the entire market to change. Here’s a quick explanation using some options terminology of what I see is happening. 

Call volume is almost like 90% today and it’s historically skewed towards calls, especially calls that put pressure on the upside skew of the vol curve (which brings in kurtosis). That’s the only thing that matters. If people buy calls -&gt; the stock will keep going up because it’s natural float is so low and big players like Musk and Baron don’t sell to cause any selling pressure. 

The equity game has changed to the point most people are now making their bullish bets through options to gain max leverage. If there are a lot of people buying calls, that’s a bullish sentiment and so the stock will go up, just like when people buy a lot of shares. People have to get that in their heads that supply/demand is what drives price moves and options provide a leveraged version of supply and demand. 

The calls on Tesla cause the name to explode even more to the upside than a boring name like say an INTC because Tesla comes with the extra special convexity/kurtosis bonus in that if the stock goes up, volatility explodes and gamma explodes. Hence market makers now will have to be desperate to buy as many shares as possible to stay delta neutral to the new skew, causing a feedback loop to bring the stock even higher.

This is also easier to do the lower the stock price, since calls become more affordable to retail. Whether that was Elon’s motivation for splitting the stock or not is unknown, but he’s a smart guy. I’m sure he probably knows.

It could theoretically work in reverse too, going down through the same short strikes it went through, but you would need a major catalyst. A major QQQ selloff or some announcement that’s bad for Elon Musk could trigger a -20% selloff since it does work in reverse, but in a natural market environment, this should not happen.

Simple STRATEGY: The strategy IMO is to buy SHARES. Buying puts is probably a no-no but you could get lucky once in a while with timing. Shorting shares is definitely a no-no unless you want to go bankrupt. Buying calls could be really good if you time it right, but the main issue with buying the calls is you have to buy it at the right vol level. Market makers are not just going to let you run them over, so they will naturally jack up this skew/call IV to a high level where they can win even selling calls and having the stock go up. For example, if Tesla is 490 now and a market maker sold a 600 call and delta hedged it by buying shares, they will win if the stock goes up to 600 even at expiration. The 600 call buyer would actually lose unless he sold earlier. Thus, shares is probably the better play. Nevertheless, the reason for these explosive up moves  is explained by options.

If you are uncomfortable with buying shares due to the high P/E and bubble like nature of Tesla, I can understand that. However, you must also understand investing should be more than a financial statement now. You must factor in things like options volume in terms of investing. Using the same mindset, this is why I would never ever invest in a stock like XOM. No retail is going in and buying XOM calls. This can be said about CSCO too. You don’t get that options pressure you want, which is a “fundamental” reason for a stock to go up. So if you don’t like Tesla since it is indeed a high P/E, you can apply this same idea and buy Apple (or Microsoft) then. It’s a lower and reasonable P/E, has similar call option volume flow, and is a much better long term investment than XOM or CSCO.",t2_7q5wojx4,False,,0,False,Tesla call volume will cause the stock to keep going up - as explained using some options terminology,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik3r8r,False,dark,0.78,,public,53,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,53,,False,,1598899494.0,,[],{},,True,,1598927854.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I come to &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;r/investing&lt;/a&gt; hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it.

,investing,"**Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment**

**Tl;dr FactSet is the most undervalued widespread SaaS/IT solution stock that exists**

If any of you have relevant experience or are friends with people in Investment Banking/other high finance, you know that Factset is the lifeblood of their financial analysis toolkit if and when it’s not Bloomberg, which isn’t even publicly traded. Factset has been around since *1978* and it’s considered a staple like Bloomberg in many wealth management firms, and it offers some of the easiest to access and understandable financial data so many newer firms focused less on trading are switching to Factset because it has a lot of the same data Bloomberg offers for half the cost. When it comes to modern financial data, Factset outcompetes Reuters and arguably Bloomberg as well due to their API services which makes Factset much more preferable for quantitative divisions of banks/hedge funds as API integration with Python/R is the most important factor for vast data lakes of financial data, this suggests Factset will be much more prepared for programming making its way into traditional finance fields. According to Factset, their mission for data delivery is to: “Integrate the data you need with your applications, web portals, and statistical packages. Whether you need [market](https://www.factset.com/products-data/market-data), [company](https://www.factset.com/products-data/core-company-data), or [alternative data](https://www.factset.com/products-data/alternative-data), FactSet flexible data delivery services give you normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our unique symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across your business. Build financial models and power customized applications with FactSet APIs in our [developer portal](https://developer.factset.com/)”. Their technical focus for their data delivery system alone should make it stand out compared to Bloomberg, whose UI is far more outdated and complex on top of not being as technically developed as Factset’s. Factset is the key provider of buy-side portfolio analysis for IBs, Hedge funds, and Private Equity firms, and it’s making its way into non-quantitative hedge funds as well because quantitative portfolio management makes automation of risk management and the application of portfolio theory so much easier, and to top it off, Factset’s scenario analysis and simulation is unique in its class. Factset also is able to automate trades based on individual manager risk tolerance and ML optimization for Forex trading as well. Not only does Factset provide solutions for financial companies, they are branching out to all corporations now and providing quantitative analytics for them in the areas of “corporate development, M&amp;A, strategy, treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations workflows”. Factset will eventually in my opinion reach out to Insurance Risk Management a lot more in the future as that’s a huge industry which has yet to see much automation of risk management yet, and with the field wide open, Factset will be the first to take advantage without a shadow of a doubt. So let’s dig into the company’s financials now:

Their latest 8k filing reported the following:

Revenue increased 2.6%, or $9.6 million, to $374.1 million compared with $364.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher sales of analytics, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions.

Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services was $1.52 billion at May 31, 2020, compared with $1.45 billion at May 31, 2019. The organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency movements, was 5.0%. The primary contributors to this growth rate were higher sales in FactSet's wealth and research workflow solutions and a price increase in the Company's international region

Adjusted operating margin improved to 35.5% compared with 34.0% in the prior year period primarily as a result of reduced employee-related operating expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 11.0% to $2.63 compared with $2.37 for the same period in fiscal 2019.

Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9.2% to $2.86 compared with $2.62 in the prior year period primarily driven by an improvement in operating results.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 15.0% compared with 18.6% a year ago, primarily due to an income tax expense in the prior year related to finalizing the Company's tax returns with no similar event for the three months ended May 31, 2020.

FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.

As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.

It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down

FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.

Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients' own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” ([https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link\_fullReport](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport)), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:

&amp;#x200B;

FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:

&amp;#x200B;

So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing *growth*. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of *32%* between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of *33%*

&amp;#x200B;

EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.

P/E has declined in the past 2 years, making it a great time to buy.

Increasing ROE despite lowering of leverage post 2016

&amp;#x200B;

Mountains of cash have been piling up in the coffers increasing chances of increased dividends for shareholders (imo dividend is too low right now, but increasing it will tempt more investors into it), and on top of that in the last 10k a large buyback expansion program was implemented for $210m worth of shares, which shows how confident they are in the company itself.

SGA expense/Gross profit has been declining despite expansion of offices

I’m a bit concerned about the skin in the game leadership has in this company, since very few executives/board members have significant holdings in the company, but the CEO himself is a FactSet veteran, and knows his way around the company. On top of that, Bloomberg remains king for trading and the fixed income security market, and Reuters beats out FactSet here as well. If FactSet really wants to increase cash flow sources, the expansion into insurance and corp dev has to be successful.

Summary: FactSet has a lot of growth still left in its industry which is already fast-growing in and of itself, and it only has more potential at its current valuation. Earnings September 24th should be a massive beat due to investment banking demand and growth plus Hedge fund requirements for data and portfolio management hasn’t gone anywhere and has likely increased due to more market opportunities to buy-in.",t2_4h8ltwha,False,,0,False,Factset DD,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikndfr,False,dark,0.6,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599006111.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr FactSet is the most undervalued widespread SaaS/IT solution stock that exists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you have relevant experience or are friends with people in Investment Banking/other high finance, you know that Factset is the lifeblood of their financial analysis toolkit if and when it’s not Bloomberg, which isn’t even publicly traded. Factset has been around since &lt;em&gt;1978&lt;/em&gt; and it’s considered a staple like Bloomberg in many wealth management firms, and it offers some of the easiest to access and understandable financial data so many newer firms focused less on trading are switching to Factset because it has a lot of the same data Bloomberg offers for half the cost. When it comes to modern financial data, Factset outcompetes Reuters and arguably Bloomberg as well due to their API services which makes Factset much more preferable for quantitative divisions of banks/hedge funds as API integration with Python/R is the most important factor for vast data lakes of financial data, this suggests Factset will be much more prepared for programming making its way into traditional finance fields. According to Factset, their mission for data delivery is to: “Integrate the data you need with your applications, web portals, and statistical packages. Whether you need &lt;a href=""https://www.factset.com/products-data/market-data""&gt;market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.factset.com/products-data/core-company-data""&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=""https://www.factset.com/products-data/alternative-data""&gt;alternative data&lt;/a&gt;, FactSet flexible data delivery services give you normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our unique symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across your business. Build financial models and power customized applications with FactSet APIs in our &lt;a href=""https://developer.factset.com/""&gt;developer portal&lt;/a&gt;”. Their technical focus for their data delivery system alone should make it stand out compared to Bloomberg, whose UI is far more outdated and complex on top of not being as technically developed as Factset’s. Factset is the key provider of buy-side portfolio analysis for IBs, Hedge funds, and Private Equity firms, and it’s making its way into non-quantitative hedge funds as well because quantitative portfolio management makes automation of risk management and the application of portfolio theory so much easier, and to top it off, Factset’s scenario analysis and simulation is unique in its class. Factset also is able to automate trades based on individual manager risk tolerance and ML optimization for Forex trading as well. Not only does Factset provide solutions for financial companies, they are branching out to all corporations now and providing quantitative analytics for them in the areas of “corporate development, M&amp;amp;A, strategy, treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations workflows”. Factset will eventually in my opinion reach out to Insurance Risk Management a lot more in the future as that’s a huge industry which has yet to see much automation of risk management yet, and with the field wide open, Factset will be the first to take advantage without a shadow of a doubt. So let’s dig into the company’s financials now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their latest 8k filing reported the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue increased 2.6%, or $9.6 million, to $374.1 million compared with $364.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher sales of analytics, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services was $1.52 billion at May 31, 2020, compared with $1.45 billion at May 31, 2019. The organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency movements, was 5.0%. The primary contributors to this growth rate were higher sales in FactSet&amp;#39;s wealth and research workflow solutions and a price increase in the Company&amp;#39;s international region&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusted operating margin improved to 35.5% compared with 34.0% in the prior year period primarily as a result of reduced employee-related operating expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 11.0% to $2.63 compared with $2.37 for the same period in fiscal 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9.2% to $2.86 compared with $2.62 in the prior year period primarily driven by an improvement in operating results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 15.0% compared with 18.6% a year ago, primarily due to an income tax expense in the prior year related to finalizing the Company&amp;#39;s tax returns with no similar event for the three months ended May 31, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients&amp;#39; own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” (&lt;a href=""https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport""&gt;https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport&lt;/a&gt;), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp""&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing &lt;em&gt;growth&lt;/em&gt;. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of &lt;em&gt;32%&lt;/em&gt; between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of &lt;em&gt;33%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"  

Today we’re going to talk about float, what it is and how you can build billion-dollar companies with it. Float is the money that a business receives today but doesn’t have to pay out until sometime in the future. Float is most commonly seen in insurance companies with customers paying premiums upfront to insure themselves against bad things happening sometime in the future. More examples include: Video game publishers, where they receive pre-orders. Commercial banking when they receive deposits and so on. 

Why is receiving money upfront so valuable even when it needs to be paid at later date? Well, you can invest it! And the longer you have to invest it, the more likely it will grow larger than the amount that you will have to eventually pay out! So, you can see how easily this can snowball. Say I owned a tiny insurance business that insured $1,000 worth of damages for a year in exchange for a $100 upfront payment. If I have $10,000 in the bank I can safely have say, five customers insured like this every year for $500. Every year I can invest the money I got from those new customers and every year the cash I have grows so I can safely insure more customers and the cash you have grows in an exponential manner. Ok cool got it. So, what does this have to do with Berkshire Hathaway?

Sometime around the mid-1960s Mr. Buffett realized, with the help of his friend Charlie Munger, that he can’t keep investing in broken down businesses and had to instead look for “franchise” business that will continue to compound his hard earned capital through thick and thin. The next thing he realized is that he couldn’t just rely on the free cash flow generated from those company’s and had to instead find low cost financing for his acquisitions. That low cost financing came in the form of an insurance float which, as we’ve seen, are the premiums paid by insurance customers up front in order to be paid out by the insurance company later. Buffett bought a ton of these insurance companies starting with National Indemnity in 1967

Wait, why did we just say that float is low cost financing? Why is it financing and what is the cost of that financing? Well, float is financing because you are receiving money today, but you have to pay it out sometime in the future, exactly like a loan. The beauty of float though is that you don’t have to pay interest on that money! The only “interest” that you have to pay on that money is the normal cost of operating your business.

We’ve already seen why float would matter so much to Buffett, but it bears repeating.  A dollar you receive today is worth more than a dollar you get a week from now because you can invest it at some rate to receive more money in the future. Buffet realized that the more float he had, the more float he could invest to buy other businesses. Float would compound in lockstep with the free-cashflow generated by his other businesses and in time create a juggernaut.

The final step in the Berkshire secret formula was increasing the duration of time between when the premiums are received and when they’re paid out. So, for Buffett, this meant buying up longer tailed insurance companies like insurance for catastrophes, and recently, Reinsurance companies.  And there you have it! This is the basic DNA of one the most successful stocks in over the past 50 years and they’re still going at it.",t2_7whqrqof,False,,0,False,Berkshire Hathaway and the incredible power of float,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ijnr09,False,dark,0.95,,public,1096,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1096,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598861638.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to talk about float, what it is and how you can build billion-dollar companies with it.

More examples include: Video game publishers, where they receive pre-orders. Commercial banking when they receive deposits and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is receiving money upfront so valuable even when it needs to be paid at later date? Well, you can invest it! And the longer you have to invest it, the more likely it will grow larger than the amount that you will have to eventually pay out! So, you can see how easily this can snowball. Say I owned a tiny insurance business that insured $1,000 worth of damages for a year in exchange for a $100 upfront payment. If I have $10,000 in the bank I can safely have say, five customers insured like this every year for $500. Every year I can invest the money I got from those new customers and every year the cash I have grows so I can safely insure more customers and the cash you have grows in an exponential manner. Ok cool got it. So, what does this have to do with Berkshire Hathaway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime around the mid-1960s Mr. Buffett realized, with the help of his friend Charlie Munger, that he can’t keep investing in broken down businesses and had to instead look for “franchise” business that will continue to compound his hard earned capital through thick and thin. The next thing he realized is that he couldn’t just rely on the free cash flow generated from those company’s and had to instead find low cost financing for his acquisitions. That low cost financing came in the form of an insurance float which, as we’ve seen, are the premiums paid by insurance customers up front in order to be paid out by the insurance company later. Buffett bought a ton of these insurance companies starting with National Indemnity in 1967&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, why did we just say that float is low cost financing? Why is it financing and what is the cost of that financing? Well, float is financing because you are receiving money today, but you have to pay it out sometime in the future, exactly like a loan. The beauty of float though is that you don’t have to pay interest on that money! The only “interest” that you have to pay on that money is the normal cost of operating your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen why float would matter so much to Buffett, but it bears repeating.  A dollar you receive today is worth more than a dollar you get a week from now because you can invest it at some rate to receive more money in the future. Buffet realized that the more float he had, the more float he could invest to buy other businesses. Float would compound in lockstep with the free-cashflow generated by his other businesses and in time create a juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step in the Berkshire secret formula was increasing the duration of time between when the premiums are received and when they’re paid out. So, for Buffett, this meant buying up longer tailed insurance companies like insurance for catastrophes, and recently, Reinsurance companies.  And there you have it! This is the basic DNA of one the most successful stocks in over the past 50 years and they’re still going at it.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Securities fraud class action brought on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired VXRT securities during the Class Period – between June 25, 2020 and July 20, 2020, inclusive. The case seeks to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

Vaxart is a clinical-stage Company purportedly engaged in the discovery and development of vaccines for a variety of diseases that would be administered orally, rather than by injection.

The class action arises from Defendants’ alleged fraudulent scheme to profit from artificially inflating the Company’s stock price by announcing false and misleading information concerning Vaxart’s oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on June 26, 2020, Vaxart issued a press release entitled, “Vaxart’s COVID-19 Vaccine Selected for the U.S. Government’s Operation Warp Speed,” falsely claiming its vaccine had been selected to participate in a non-human challenge study, organized and funded by OWS.  This announcement sent the price of Vaxart shares rocketing higher.

In furtherance of the scheme, Defendants amended controlling shareholder Armistice’s existing warrant agreements, allowing Armistice to exercise all of its warrants immediately and sell 27.6 million Vaxart shares, reaping profits of approximately $200 million.  Defendants also issued millions of dollars in favorable stock options to Vaxart’s most senior executives.

The Complaint alleges that on July 25, 2020, details emerged revealing Defendants’ deception concerning their alleged pump and dump scheme. In particular, on July 25, 2020, The New York Times published an article entitled, “Corporate Insiders Pocket $1 Billion in Rush for Coronavirus Vaccine,” covering suspiciously timed stock bets that had generated significant profits for senior executives and board members at companies developing vaccines and treatments. Vaxart was featured prominently in the article, and it clarified “Vaxart is not among the companies selected to receive significant financial support from Warp Speed.” In response to this news, the price of Vaxart shares dropped sharply lower on July 27, 2020 from $12.29 to $11.16.

Today though, due to the stock split with Apple, I am trying to log in on both app and desktop and the site is super slow and keeps giving me error messages when I log in.

What seems most obvious is that Vanguard is crashing because everyone is trying to log into their accounts all at once, maybe because of Apple’s stock split.

However I wonder, is this just normal behavior this early when the market is just opening?

Do not do what I did and hit submit payment 100 times hoping to get a confirmation. It says my account has way more now than I intended and that is even in my checking account.

,investing,"On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players. This follows several other media reports over the last few years (CNBC, WSJ) that AT&amp;T has been considering selling its DirecTV business, as well as comments by DISH management that a combination of Dish's satellite operations with DirecTV are inevitable.

Goldman issued the following report this morning outlining some interesting thoughts:

**Why would AT&amp;T sell DirecTV? Three potential objectives:**

1. **Streamlining AT&amp;T's operations to focus on mobile, broadband and streaming entertainment.** AT&amp;T is the most diversified company in the US communications and media sector. While this diversification has the potential to yield certain competitive advantages, such as AT&amp;T's bundles of wireless and broadband connectivity with its streaming video services such as HBO Max, we believe it has also created a degree of operational complexity. This is especially the case, in our view, for the DirecTV satellite TV service, which is experiencing significant structural headwinds owing to industry-wide cord-cutting that is not only resulting in customer losses, but reducing the appeal of the service in AT&amp;T's product bundles.

With AT&amp;T having already made its flagship HBO Max streaming service available to its DirecTV customers, we believe the company has now captured the majority of the product and cost synergies from this asset. As such AT&amp;T may view that it can be a more focused and nimble competitor in its core mobile, broadband and streaming markets by divesting control of its satellite TV operations in the US. Indeed, separating from AT&amp;T could also allow DirecTV to operate in a structure that works better for a mature cash-generative business, which could benefit AT&amp;T to the extent it retained a stake in the company.

2) **Accelerate AT&amp;T's balance sheet deleveraging.** Since completing the acquisition of Time Warner in 2018, AT&amp;T has reduced it net debt by $25 billion from $177 billion to $152 billion as of 2Q20 through a combination of strong FCF, asset sales and other asset monetizations. While this has lowered its net debt/EBITDA from 3.3x to 2.7x, the company remains well above its historical leverage in the low-2x range, which we believe remains its long-term target. As such, we believe that AT&amp;T could likely consider any transaction that enabled it to accelerate its delevering by pulling forward value for non-core assets. Even if a transaction were only modestly delevering, in terms of its net leverage ratio, we believe that simply lowering the gross dollar amount of outstanding debt could improve AT&amp;T's financial flexibility by making it less reliant on the investment grade credit markets during a period of significant economic uncertainty.

3) **Achieve further cost efficiencies and synergies.** This opportunity would likely only apply to a combination with another pay-TV operator (vs. a financial buyer) owing to significant overlapping costs. We have not attempted to estimate synergies from this type of hypothetical combination, but AT&amp;T's own combination of DirecTV with its U-verse business in 2015 could be a potential precedent.

That merger represented the combination of DirecTV's base of 20 million US satellite TV subscribers with AT&amp;T's base of 6 million landline U-verse video subscribers. While these services were based on different infrastructure, the company initially estimated cost synergies would exceed $1.6 billion on an annual run rate basis by year-three after closing. One year later, AT&amp;T increased this target to $2.5 billion, based on lower programming costs across the combined video operations (DirecTV + U-verse) with other savings from core operational functions (e.g., truck rolls, billing, customer care, advertising, etc.).

**A combination with Dish could face regulatory scrutiny.**

For details on the potential regulatory considerations facing a potential merger of DirecTV and Dish, please see takeaways from our discussion with Andrew Lipman, partner at law firm Morgan Lewis, at the 28th Annual Communacopia conference in 2019. Here is our summary of Mr. Lipman's comments, which you can find in the report cited above:

Mr. Lipman believes that Dish and DirecTV could potentially get a deal through federal regulatory authorities if there was a will from both companies to merge. This is despite the failure of a similar proposal to merge between the two satellite operators in 2002. He believes that the pay-TV market has changed drastically since the original merger attempt (i.e. fiber and cable presence in rural areas, OTT offerings). Mr. Lipman believes that such a deal could potentially be structured in different ways to address the government's likely concerns that rural areas could be hurt by this merger including 1) price freezes or 2) allowing the two companies to combine back office functions, prior to a potential full merger.

**What impact would a sale of DirecTV have on the pay-TV market?**

We do not believe that a partial sale of DirecTV to financial partners, or any entity which would continue to operate DirecTV as an independent satellite TV operator, would have a material impact on the pay-TV market. This is because such a hypothetical transaction would not significantly impact the number of competitors. To some extent, it could yield a modest increase in competition as DirecTV would now compete directly with AT&amp;T's other pay-TV services, including its new Internet-based service AT&amp;T TV. However, we do not see this as a material change in the overall competitive backdrop.

A theoretical combination of DirecTV with Dish would represent a merger of the 2nd (DirecTV) and 4th (Dish) largest pay-TV providers in the US, resulting in a new company with over 25 million video customers (as of 2019), ranking it ahead of the current #1 Comcast (21.2 million). As such, a merger of the US's two satellite TV operators could lower competition among traditional facilities-based pay-TV providers. However, as we detailed in our recent initiation report on the US media sector, traditional pay-TV services are already experiencing material subscriber losses owing to competition from new streaming services. The pressures on satellite TV providers have been particularly intense, with the combined customer bases of DirecTV and Dish declining by 13% in 2019 vs. video subscriber declines of approximately 3% for the major cable providers. As such, a theoretical combination of these companies could potentially enable them to generate synergies that position them to remain viable competitors in the pay-TV sector longer than if they remained independent.

**What is DirecTV's financial contribution to AT&amp;T**

AT&amp;T does not report any financial or operating metrics for its DirecTV satellite TV operations. This business is included within the company's Entertainment Group segment, which in 2019 generated $45 billion of revenue (25% of consolidated revenue) and $10 billion in EBITDA (17% of consolidated EBITDA). Below, we provide our rough estimates for the size of the DirecTV subscriber base and its contributions to AT&amp;T's revenue and EBITDA in 2019. These estimates are intended to be illustrative in order to provide context for the scale of DirecTV within AT&amp;T's consolidated operations and relative to peers in the pay-TV sector.

**We estimate that AT&amp;T ended 2019 with approximately 16 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers**, out of 19.5 million total Premium TV subscribers. As of YE2018, when AT&amp;T last disclosed the mix of it Premium TV subscriber base, the company had 19.2 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers and 3.7 million U-verse video subscribers. In 2019, the company's combined Premium TV subscriber base declined 15%, which we believe was primarily driven by losses of DirecTV customers owing to the end of promotional pricing. For context, the large cable operators, whose video + broadband service bundles are more comparable to the U-verse offerings, saw their video subscriber bases decline by approximately 3% in 2019. If we assume the same trend played-out with U-verse, then that implies the DirecTV subscriber base declined 17% in 2019.

For context, this implies that DirecTV ended 2019 roughly tied with Charter (16.1 million video subscribers) as the second largest pay-TV service in the US. This compares to Comcast's video subscriber base of 21.2 million and Dish's satellite TV subscriber base of 9.4 million.

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $25 billion of revenue in 2019**. We arrive at this estimate by assuming that ARPU for DirecTV subscribers is comparable to AT&amp;T's reported Premium TV ARPU in 2019 of $121. This implies that in 2019 the DirecTV satellite TV service contributed 57% of Entertainment Group revenue (14% of consolidated).

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $7 billion of EBITDA in 2019**. This estimate implies an EBITDA margin in the mid/high 20%s. We believe this is a reasonable rough estimate based on few factors. First, DirecTV's closest peer, Dish, operates with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. Based on AT&amp;T's scale in video vs. Dish, we estimate that its average monthly programming costs per Premium TV subscriber is approximately $5 lower than DISH's. This estimated cost advantage represents approximately 4-percentage points of margin benefit for DirecTV vs. this peer.

Second, we assume additional scale benefits in SG&amp;A. For context, when AT&amp;T acquired DirecTV in 2015, its US satellite TV operations generated an EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. While we estimate that the DirecTV subscriber base in the US has declined by over 20% since the acquisition, we also estimate that AT&amp;T has increased the service's ARPU by over 10% and generated cost synergies, which management previously estimated would reach a run-rate of $2.5 billion. We therefore believe it is reasonable to estimate that margins have remained at least flat, and likely improved, since the acquisition of DirecTV, despite material subscriber losses.

Our approximate estimate for DirecTV's EBITDA implies that in 2019 it contributed nearly 70% of Entertainment Group EBITDA (12% of consolidated).",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$T - thoughts on the potential sale of DirecTV,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik5l65,False,dark,0.73,,public,14,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598933533.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players.

 With the work from home model becoming increasingly engrained in every day life, it's no wonder more people are putting in efforts to better their living conditions. Sales from home improvement retail stores like Home Depot surged in the spring, and continue to level off near term. With these tail winds comes a respective demand for homes. Home sales were up 15.5% (YoY) in July as mortgage rates continue to parallel the ""low interest rate"" environment, sliding below 3%. Re-financing was a viable option for many, and will continue to be an outlet for people to free up cash flow.  


 **The 10YR Treasury (TNX)**  has broken out in the last few days, topping .75, the highest since mid-June. A weak dollar and political unrest impacting our next stimulus could cause the 10YR note to rise to the .8 level, where if it breaks out, the market will prohibit multiple expansion. As market makers continue to buy the underlying assets on calls, numbers show that 75% of the volume is for contracts expiring in the next two weeks.   


**Limbach Holdings (LMB)** has bounced over 250% from its March low of $2.37, attracting more and more retail investors.

**Goldman (Neutral rating, $295 price target) comments on today's announcement of $5bn equity raise:**

""We believe key points to help contextualize this news includes:

1) $5 bn of equity issuance would represent about 1% incremental shares based on the 8/31/2020 close.

2) The prospectus states that the use of proceeds would be to further strengthen the balance sheet, and for general corporate purposes.

3) Tesla has a history of issuing equity, but unlike this proposed offering Tesla has typically announced offerings on the day it filed or within a few weeks of filing its 10-Q/10-K. Further, while the company commented on its 4Q19 EPS call that it was not capital constrained, investing as fast as it sensibly could and generating positive cash flow, Tesla has also raised capital post making those comments (the company last issued new equity in February 2020). Finally, the company has capacity expansion plans underway at several factories, and per its last 10-K Tesla expects average annual capex to be $2.5-$3.5 bn from 2020-2022.

,investing,"I've seen lots of conflicting answers to the question ""I want to put $ in stocks for [x] years.""  Most agree that buying stocks for a shorter horizon than 5 years (for house down payment, etc.) is a bad idea.  Beyond that though, you see some people saying 7, 10, or 15 years is safe.

I'm not going to say I know for sure what is optimal, but what I can do is provide some actual numbers.  While past returns are no guarantee of future returns, on a large enough timescale we can at least build a decent model.  I looked at the past **90 years of total returns** for the S&amp;P 500 (including dividends), Baa corporate bonds, US T-bonds, and 3-month T-bills.

I calculated rolling total return for various holding periods across the entire range.  I then compared them to each other to see how often the stocks had a negative return, and how often they were outperformed by the various bond classes.

[Here are the results.](https://i.imgur.com/YGHcOi1.png)

While I wouldn't draw any **strong** conclusions from this, it certainly casts a lot of doubt on people advising that 7 or 10 years is adequate for 100% equity when you have about a 27-34% chance of losing to bonds.  On the other end of the spectrum, this paints many target date funds as overly conservative, for example the [Vanguard 2045 fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtivx) holds about 10% bonds even though they have about half that chance of beating stocks.

I expect these numbers may be quite surprising to some people, especially since the past decade has been a generous bull market that makes equities look invincible.  Anyway, if anybody has other quantitative means of looking at this, please share.  Happy investing!

&lt;p&gt;I calculated rolling total return for various holding periods across the entire range.  I then compared them to each other to see how often the stocks had a negative return, and how often they were outperformed by the various bond classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/YGHcOi1.png""&gt;Here are the results.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I wouldn&amp;#39;t draw any &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; conclusions from this, it certainly casts a lot of doubt on people advising that 7 or 10 years is adequate for 100% equity when you have about a 27-34% chance of losing to bonds.  On the other end of the spectrum, this paints many target date funds as overly conservative, for example the &lt;a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtivx""&gt;Vanguard 2045 fund&lt;/a&gt; holds about 10% bonds even though they have about half that chance of beating stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect these numbers may be quite surprising to some people, especially since the past decade has been a generous bull market that makes equities look invincible.  Anyway, if anybody has other quantitative means of looking at this, please share.  Happy investing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Based on some comments I don&amp;#39;t think I communicated this clearly, but it&amp;#39;s more about how to evaluate asset allocation based on how far you are from horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Seeing the recent rapid rise of the market and some stock went skyrocketed, I am curious about what would the academia think on the phenomenon, So I looked for research papers that were published on journals and would like to share this particular paper on 'bubble' with you all.

The paper [bubble for fama](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v131y2019i1p20-43.html) is written by Greenwood, Robin, Shleifer, Andrei and You, Yang and was published in the Journal of Financial Economics, one of the most eminent financial journal. They aimed to evaluate the saying from Eugene Fama, 2013 Nobel laureate in economic sciences. Who once said in 2016 ""For bubbles, I want a systematic way of identifying them. It’s a simple proposition. You have to be able to predict that there is some end to it. All the tests people have done trying to do that don’t work. Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles.""  Here are what the authors of the paper have done.

First of all, they put their focus on industries instead of individual stocks. A major reason for this is bubbles, by nature is very hard to define, using industry as a unit ensure the same phenomenon is experienced by the same enough firms. (Imagine a penny stock that can go up by 100% then drop in an hour, is it very hard to define if it is a bubble for statistical analysis). Researchers defined an industry is experiencing a 'price runs up' if the return for the past 2 years is over 100%, and define a bubble burst to be over 40% drops in the following 2 years after the peak. 

Using data from 1928 to 2014. Researchers have identified 40 'runs up' in the US stock market. And they realise the Eugene Fama is mostly right in the sense that you couldn't tell if a price run-up will be followed by a burst of not. In the 40 episodes, 21 of them experienced an over 40% crash while the other 19 episodes didn't. So you cannot say something is in a bubble just because their price has gone up by a lot. And the average time needed for the bubble episodes to reach the peaks varies from 0 months to 17 months. So it would be against the stat if you were to short sell a rapid raising industry, not only you would be proven wrong about half the time, you also need to have extreme deep pocket combined with a lot of patients to win the battle. For episodes that indeed crashed, on average they will return to the market level, and generally speaking, the market is always rising given long enough time. The implication here is even if you buy in a bubble industry, you might still retain some gains after the bubble burst (most likely to be beaten by the market tho).

However, there's more to come. The researchers further study who's the differences between the crashing episodes and the non-crashing episodes. They found that there are some characteristics that distinguish crashing and non-crashing, all with p-value &lt; 10% (That is they have 1/10 chances their statistical significance is happened by chance). They are: 

1. 1-year change in volatility (Volatility from year T-1 to now, minus volatility from year T-2 to year T-1). On average the volatility change is positive for crashed episodes and slightly negative for non-crash episodes.
2. firm age. Crashed episodes are on average 15 percentile rank younger than non-crashed episodes.
3. age tilt (to capture whether the price run-up occurred disproportionately among the younger firms in the industry). Crashed episodes' price run-up has a higher concentration in younger firms.
4. Percentage of Issuers ( percentage of firms in the industry which issued new shares within the last two years) Crashed episodes have a higher percentage of issuers.
5. Acceleration (Difference between 2 years return to (year T-2 to year T-1 return) Crashed episodes have a higher acceleration. Around 30% higher in fact.

Then the researchers asked, can these characteristics predict the coming 2 years return for the 40 episodes identified? The answer is yes and no. After going through some statistic measure and control for market return. None of these characteristics can predict future returns with satisfactory statistical power. However, if we don't control for market return, all of the above can predict a lower return within the coming 24 months. And on the [online appendix](http://docplayer.net/136929952-Internet-appendix-with-supplement-results-for-bubbles-for-fama-robin-greenwood-andrei-shleifer-and-yang-you-last-updated-sep.html) , they also show using these characteristics as signal to avoid bubble can boost the return to 10% more compared with the benchmark index.

TLDR: 

\-You can't say something is a bubble just because its price goes up rapidly

\-However, there are variables that can help you the identify potential bubbles

\-And you can boost your return by avoiding to trade the bubble",t2_1q2o9ywj,False,,0,False,Financial Literature Sharing: Bubble For Fama,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikhgpf,False,dark,0.4,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598982969.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the recent rapid rise of the market and some stock went skyrocketed, I am curious about what would the academia think on the phenomenon, So I looked for research papers that were published on journals and would like to share this particular paper on &amp;#39;bubble&amp;#39; with you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper &lt;a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v131y2019i1p20-43.html""&gt;bubble for fama&lt;/a&gt; is written by Greenwood, Robin, Shleifer, Andrei and You, Yang and was published in the Journal of Financial Economics, one of the most eminent financial journal. They aimed to evaluate the saying from Eugene Fama, 2013 Nobel laureate in economic sciences. Who once said in 2016 &amp;quot;For bubbles, I want a systematic way of identifying them. It’s a simple proposition. You have to be able to predict that there is some end to it. All the tests people have done trying to do that don’t work. Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles.&amp;quot;  Here are what the authors of the paper have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, they put their focus on industries instead of individual stocks. A major reason for this is bubbles, by nature is very hard to define, using industry as a unit ensure the same phenomenon is experienced by the same enough firms. (Imagine a penny stock that can go up by 100% then drop in an hour, is it very hard to define if it is a bubble for statistical analysis). Researchers defined an industry is experiencing a &amp;#39;price runs up&amp;#39; if the return for the past 2 years is over 100%, and define a bubble burst to be over 40% drops in the following 2 years after the peak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data from 1928 to 2014. Researchers have identified 40 &amp;#39;runs up&amp;#39; in the US stock market. And they realise the Eugene Fama is mostly right in the sense that you couldn&amp;#39;t tell if a price run-up will be followed by a burst of not. In the 40 episodes, 21 of them experienced an over 40% crash while the other 19 episodes didn&amp;#39;t. So you cannot say something is in a bubble just because their price has gone up by a lot. And the average time needed for the bubble episodes to reach the peaks varies from 0 months to 17 months. So it would be against the stat if you were to short sell a rapid raising industry, not only you would be proven wrong about half the time, you also need to have extreme deep pocket combined with a lot of patients to win the battle. For episodes that indeed crashed, on average they will return to the market level, and generally speaking, the market is always rising given long enough time. The implication here is even if you buy in a bubble industry, you might still retain some gains after the bubble burst (most likely to be beaten by the market tho).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s more to come. The researchers further study who&amp;#39;s the differences between the crashing episodes and the non-crashing episodes. They found that there are some characteristics that distinguish crashing and non-crashing, all with p-value &amp;lt; 10% (That is they have 1/10 chances their statistical significance is happened by chance). They are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-year change in volatility (Volatility from year T-1 to now, minus volatility from year T-2 to year T-1). On average the volatility change is positive for crashed episodes and slightly negative for non-crash episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;firm age. Crashed episodes are on average 15 percentile rank younger than non-crashed episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;age tilt (to capture whether the price run-up occurred disproportionately among the younger firms in the industry). Crashed episodes&amp;#39; price run-up has a higher concentration in younger firms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage of Issuers ( percentage of firms in the industry which issued new shares within the last two years) Crashed episodes have a higher percentage of issuers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acceleration (Difference between 2 years return to (year T-2 to year T-1 return) Crashed episodes have a higher acceleration. Around 30% higher in fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers asked, can these characteristics predict the coming 2 years return for the 40 episodes identified? The answer is yes and no. After going through some statistic measure and control for market return. None of these characteristics can predict future returns with satisfactory statistical power. However, if we don&amp;#39;t control for market return, all of the above can predict a lower return within the coming 24 months. And on the &lt;a href=""http://docplayer.net/136929952-Internet-appendix-with-supplement-results-for-bubbles-for-fama-robin-greenwood-andrei-shleifer-and-yang-you-last-updated-sep.html""&gt;online appendix&lt;/a&gt; , they also show using these characteristics as signal to avoid bubble can boost the return to 10% more compared with the benchmark index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the paper&amp;#39;s focus is on the industry level, but I believe the discovery is linked with strong behavioural/economics explanation and is applicable to individual stocks. One thing I forgot to mention above is that almost all the bubbles happened in a bull market. Reading this paper reminds me of today&amp;#39;s market. I am still a student and relatively new to the investing world. English isn&amp;#39;t my first language so apologies if there are places that isn&amp;#39;t clear enough. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-You can&amp;#39;t say something is a bubble just because its price goes up rapidly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-However, there are variables that can help you the identify potential bubbles&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from the SEC filing, Linus provides some perspective as someone who is very well-versed with Corsair

Pros
Dominant position in the industry
Brand loyalty and established business


Cons
Have been making losses before 2020
Limited room for growth beyond the position they are in
If COVID-19 drags on, they will continue to do well, and even after the pandemic some people may end up buying equipment for home use in the LR.
Questionable acquisition of OriginPC
Does not own any factories

Conclusion:
Luke says short due to volatility and hype in the short term, long in the long term.

Linus would ""not buy the stock at all"", due to his belief of the company's potential, and he thinks that he average investor wouldn't buy the hype around rgb peripherals.
